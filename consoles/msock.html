<p>This document is meant to provide 'the basics' of connecting
asynchronous serial devices together. It starts with my two favorite
secrets, and then tries to take the mystery out of the 'magic' of the
physical layer async serial connection. There are also definitions of
terms, for the newer folks, as well as troubleshooting and testing
techniques.</p>

<p>There is one other source to check for ideas, suggestions, and
maybe some console-related news tidbits;

<h3>How Simple Is It?</h3>

<p>Sometimes, folks look at serial communications and think it's
a Black Magic, with so many different connectors and all of those
different wires...there is just too much to know!</p>

<p>While I'll admit that modems, and even some serial hookups, can
be more like a Black Art, it's certainly not magic. But, after many
years of hacking with RS-232 serial devices, I'm here to tell you
that the basics are pretty simple. With just a bit of knowledge, you
can look like a serial magician, and amaze your friends and
co-workers. Here's <b>my first secret:</b></p>

      <p><b>Pre-built RJ-45 serial adapters make serial
hookups easy, consistently</b></p>


      
      <p>Let's consider the task of connecting a serial device to
a console server or patch panel. To make our lives easier, we will use
pre-wired adapters that match the RJ-45 signaling pinouts for our
terminal server. (You can find more information about these on any of
my <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/#guides">Console
Connection Guides</a>.)</p>
      
      <p><img src="2x2.gif" align="left" height="173" width="206">If 
      you think that there are dozens of connectors and adapters to choose 
      from, the number of possible combinations is huge, right? But, 
      consider these factoids;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the DB-25 connector is probably the most common
connector for async serial. </li>
        <li>the DB-25 connector comes in two basic wiring formats
(DTE and DCE) </li>
        <li>the DB-25 connector comes in only two genders (male
and female) </li>      
      </ul>
      
      <p>When you consider that more than half of serial ports
that you will need to deal with use the DB-25 adapter, then you really
only have four possibilities for that one connector format, and four is
not too many to deal with, is it?</p>

      <p>"But" I hear you say, "there are lots of connector
types, so there's still many more possible combinations." </p>

      <p><img src="2x2x2.gif" x-sas-useimagewidth="" x-sas-useimageheight="" align="left" height="193" width="226">Well, when you also consider that the majority
of async serial devices (80+ percent, based on common hardware in use
during the last 10 years inclusive) use either the <b>DB-9</b>
or the <b>DB-25</b> connector for serial connections, you
simply add another 2x2 matrix. That is, when you have to work with both
DB-25 and DB-9 connections together, you now have eight choices that
cover most cases, and that's still not too many possibilities, is it?</p>

      <p>For each type of connector you have to work with, you
add four more adapter possibilities. (Male/female, DTE/DCE.) For DB-25
and DB-9, you'll need to stock 8 different adapters wired for your
brand of terminal server.</p>

      <p>When you are connecting two devices together, you won't
have more than eight possible combinations! (In fact, you'll usually
have fewer than that! Keep reading!) </p>

connect a device to your console server, you already know which
connector type the device is using, and you already know which gender
the connector is, right? When you already know two of the three sides
of our cube, you are left with just two possible choices, either DTE or
DCE. How simple is that?</p>

      <p>Now, you could just take one of each adapter with you,
and try them one at a time, and test the connection through some
application(s) to see if the connection is working. But that still
leaves some question if the connection doesn't work. So, here's <b>my

      <p>Passive Signal Tracers do not require batteries, and
simply show you the 'logic state' (positive or negative voltage, or no
voltage at all) on each of the important signal leads. The animation
below illustrates how to use a passive signal tracer to make sure you
are using the correct (DCE/DTE) adapter for your application. (The

the instructions below.)</p>
      
      <p>For this example, I will presume two thing;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The RJ-45 cable is already connected to some other device<br>
(Either a console server, or a compatible adapter and device) </li>
        <li>The RJ-45 adapter is wired to work with the RJ-45 cable<br>
(Read the section <a href="#RJ-45ports">Connecting
Devices with RJ-45</a> Ports below.) </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>First thing:</b> Determine what gender
and type of connector you need on your adapters. When you pick up the
two adapters you need to choose between (one DCE and one DTE), you
should also pick up the appropriate passive Signal Tracer (DB-9 or
DB-25) as well!</p>

<p>James Newton points out another benefit of the Passive Signal Tracer,
because it can show you when a signal is truly an RS-232 signal (with
positive and negative signalling in reference to the signal ground),
or a DC-biased signal, such as a TTL interface. (For TTL info, you
can check the <a href="http://techref.massmind.org/techref/io/serial/ttl-rs232.htm">TTL

      <p>If you are only connecting two devices that are close
together, you may not think about this. You should get in the habit of
making sure the physical connection is in place before you start trying
to test the software settings.</p>
      
      <p>Most devices will talk to each other with async settings
of <b>9600</b> bps, <b>8</b> data bits, <b>N</b>o
parity, and <b>1</b> stop bit...often referred to as <b>9600
8-N-1</b>. But sometimes you will find that one of the devices is
at a different speed. Less often, you may find that one device is using
a different number of data bit, or a different parity than normal.
Rarely, you will find that the settings for Flow Control or Handshaking
are not compatible, and will need to be changed. But what this really
means to you is; when you connect two devices together, and they don't
"just work", you usually start to fuss with these different settings.
You can spend a lot of time, going through all sorts of changes (and
this takes time) before you decide to check if the wires are connected

      <p><b>Connecting two devices together</b></p>
      
      <p>We've already seen how connecting one device to a patch
panel boils down to two choices of adapters. So, how many choices do
you have when you are connecting two devices? No, not four...just two!
Here's why:</p>
      
      <p><img src="Tracers/test2.gif" alt="DB-9/RJ-45/Signal Monitor" x-sas-useimagewidth="" x-sas-useimageheight="" align="right" height="25" width="171">Each device technically <b>does</b>
have two choices, which does give you a total of four possibilities, <b>but</b>
two of the four will work, and two will not. (For the technical nerds
in the audience, the simple Boolean equation for this would be a basic
Exclusive-OR function.)</p>

      <p>The simple explanation is this: for device number one,
you already know connector type and gender...just pick one of the two
possible adapters, and connect that to the device, knowing that this
will work out just fine. (No matter which of the two adapters you have
chosen, you <b>will</b> be able to communicate with the
other device!) </p>
      
      <p>Now, for device number two, take both of the possible
adapters, trusting that one of the two will give you the correct
signals. You only need to worry about testing your two choices on one
end of the cable. Take your trusty <a href="#leds">signal
tracer</a> with you, and all will be well. If you don't have a <a href="#leds">signal tracer</a>, buy one. If you local
computer stores don't have one, you can buy them from <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA 
Cables &amp; Networks</a>.)</p>

      <p>If this *still* doesn't make sense to you, all I can ask
is that you either;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>trust me on this, try it, and see if it seems to be
        true. </li>
        <li>get out your paper and pencil, and start to
        brainstorm a bunch of different cases. </li>
        <li>catch me at a BayLISA meeting, or a BoF sometime, and
        we'll go over it. :-) </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once you have your physical connection in place, you are
ready to start testing the connections, confident that the your
connections are correct. </p>

need to match the output leads from one device to the input leads on
another device (connecting <b>complimentary</b> signals

      <p>Some devices have RJ-45 connectors for their serial
ports. In larger environments, you may also use a console server. In
order to provide higher port density, and to make connecting easier,
many of these console servers use RJ-45 connectors. (All 8 wires will
be used!)</p>

      <p>My basic test fixture for checking the signals of
devices in an RJ-45 environment is to connect a signal monitor to a
DB-25 to RJ-45 adapter that is wired to work with the console devices
in use. In a Cisco server environment, I'll use a <a href="Cisco/ciscokit.html">CFDTE</a> (Female DTE,
Cisco part 29-0810-01 ) adapter, and then I use an ethernet cable to
connect to the RJ-45 connectors that I want to check. The signals are
then displayed on the signal tracer. The test cable, and the adapter
schematic, are shown at the right.</p>

      <p>You can test the signals at your patch panel or console
server, or console ports on devices, to determine which signals are
outputs, and then you can find the appropriate adapter to use on the
other devices that you wish to attach to these ports. </p>

<p>Many RJ-45/DB-25 and RJ-45/DB-9 adapters are designed to help
connect RS-232 devices to a proprietary RJ-45 wiring scheme. There
are many wiring schemes to choose from. (Since you cannot tell from
the case of most adapters what wiring schema was used inside, if you
build your own adapters, you should always label your adapters well,
so you can tell them apart.) I prefer buying pre-built adapters, and
I like my adapters to be fully wired for hardware handshaking and
hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. I find that the consistency means I
don't have to wonder if an adapter wiring problem is to blame if a
connection won't work.</p>

<p>If you use pre-built RJ-45 adapters to connect your devices to
your terminal servers, and a signal tracer to confirm that the
signals are matched properly, then when you pick the right adapters
(DTE and DCE, with the correct connector type and gender), you can be
fairly certain that when you get 2 &amp; 3 matched (inputs to
outputs), you will also have all of the other pins straightened out
as well.</p>

right adapter combinations look wrong. If you use a signal tracer to
get the connection correct, you will have more confidence to check the
software settings if the connection doesn't work immediately. This is
especially true if you need to take more than ten steps between
connecting the adapters, and testing the connection!</p>

<p>When both lights (2 &amp; 3) are lit when the signal

settings! If you only have pin 2, or pin 3 lit when you join both

that you will see anything on the display when you try to type.</p>

device (read: fastest way to find the correct answer the first time) is
to read the manual for the device. If the settings are fixed, the
manual will often tell you. If the settings are programmable by
hardware (switches or jumpers), the manual will show you where to look
and how to tell what settings are being used. If the setting is
programmable in software, the manual can usually tell you what command
to send to the device to see the current settings. </p>

<p>If you can't find the manual, you'll be glad to read that most
console ports, and terminal server ports, will use <b>9600 bps</b> as
a default setting. If you make a point of using the default settings,
most things that you connect to the terminal server will work without
extra fuss.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>      
      <p>If you are using a terminal emulation program to test
your connection, try sending a carriage return (press the [<b>enter</b>]
key) a couple of times. This will 'wake-up' most devices, and the
device will send some characters back to you, like a log in prompt. If
that doesn't work, try pressing the [<b>space</b>] key, or
the [<b>*</b>] (asterisk) key a few times.</p>

      <blockquote>        
        <p><b>Modem Tip #1:</b> Modems may not echo
the characters you type, or return a prompt if you just type [<b>enter</b>].
To test a connection to a modem, you should send a basic AT command to
the modem (just type <b>AT</b> and press [<b>enter</b>]),
and the modem should respond by sending you "OK" .</p>

<p>If you are getting unreadable characters back in response to your
typing, you probably have a speed, or a parity mismatch. Try changing
the speed on your terminal package, and try testing again. Keep
testing different speeds until you find one that works. (If you have
tried them all, and none seemed to work, you may have a
<a href="#parity">parity mismatch</a>.</p>

<p><table border="0" width="100%">

    <tr>
      <td>
      <p>Most modems will auto-configure their serial port speed
to match whatever device is connected to their data ports. (The secret
here is to have the attached device send some characters to the modem <b>before</b>
the modem accepts a call.) While this 'feature' makes most modems "Plug
and Play", it will also restrict a modem to use very slow connection
speeds.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Modem Tip #2:</b> If you are connecting
a modem to a console port, you should find out how fast the modem's
serial port can go. Then find out how fast the console port can go.
Then choose the highest speed <b>common to both devices!</b>
Set the modem and the serial port to that highest speed. This increases
the chances of connecting at higher modem speeds, as well as giving
your modem the chance to use modem-to-modem compression, if your modems
are configured to use it.</p>

      <p><b><a name="parity"></a>Hacking parity, data bits, stop bits </b></p>

      <p>Most devices use <b>8-N-1</b> (<b>8</b>
data bits, <b>N</b>o Parity, and <b>1</b>
Stop bit) as their default setting. Normally, you don't want to change
these settings on the devices that you are connecting.</p>

      <p>The second most common setting is <b>7-E-1</b>
(<b>7</b> data bits, <b>E</b>ven Parity, and <b>1</b>

communications services, or using X-25 packet switching for
communications. </p>

<p>If you have tried all of the serial speeds, and still only see
'garbage' characters, set the speed back to 9600, and try a different
parity setting...and then try the different speeds again if 9600
didn't work. (Of course, you <b>could try</b> reading the manual for
the device you are attaching, or check the settings on that device,
and then set your terminal server port settings to match. ;-)</p>

<a name="length"></a>
<p><b>Cable Lengths</b></p>

<p>The RS-232 specification called for no more than 50 feet. However,
I've had success with much greater distances in the past, depending
on the devices being connected (driver voltages), cable length, cable
type, shielded or not, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.digi.com">DigiCorp folks</a> have posted a
note on their support pages that recommends that the cable length be
no more than <b>2500 picofarad</b> in capacitance, where each
connector has a 'cost' of 100 pf, and then you need to find out how
many picofarads-per-foot your cabling is rated. More info is
available on their
<a href="http://support.digi.com/support/techsupport/common/cables/reference/cabling_specifications.html">Tech
Support Specifications Page</a>. Your mileage may vary. Older
Macintosh computers had lower voltages (~6-9v) than the RS-232
specification (~25v), and as a result, their range seems shorter to
me.</p>

<p>Twisted Pair cable can help extend the range (and often has a
lower capacitance...hmmm...), but the twists don't often help reduce
line noise, because the various vendors use different RJ-45 wiring
schemes. As a result, You often have your most susceptible leads
(data) twisted together, versus twisted with a fairly static signal
(like ground, or handshaking leads).</p>

<p>Shielded cable can help reduce noise, but the cost is higher than
for normal CAT-5. You can usually achieve good noise isolation if you
pay attention to WHERE your cables are placed. Avoid laying data
cables parallel with AC power cables, or laying on/near transformers
or fluorescent lighting ballasts (both are strong sources of
electromagnetic radiation).</p>

<p><b><a name="apacn"></a>Pre-wired
cabled and adapters</b></p>

<p>Some of the Console Server equipment manufacturers also sell
some adapters or
cables, but you cannot get the full matrix from any of the
manufacturers. My preference is to stock a complete set of adapters
for the hardware that I need to support, and to buy them pre-built
instead of building them myself. I try to keep enough stock on hand
to ensure that I can support any surprise machine deliveries.&nbsp;Part
of the clean-up steps after a maintenance window should be to make sure you
have enough adapters on-hand...if you used a bunch during the
downtime, it's probably time to order more. I keep a minimum of 5 of
everything, with 10-15 of each adapter that we use the most
often. (Check my <a href="wheretobuy.html">where to buy
page</a> for more information.)</p>

<p>Between the cost of the adapter components, and my time to build
and label them, I save money buying pre-built adapters in bulk. (And
at my billing rates, you probably don't want me building adapters for
you! ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.americable.com/">Americable</a> made a
conscious effort to build up a series of console adapter kits, and to
find the DataTran signal tracers. You can buy specific adapters (and
custom RJ-45 to RJ-45 cables) in any quantities, as well as the kits
themselves. In the summer of 2003, Americable merged with another
company to become <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA
Cables &amp; Networks</a>,
and APACN continued to make these parts and kits, though you would need 
to purchase in large quantites. (This is still a
great option if you are running a large site, or buying for many sites
or offices.) In the end of 2007, APACN became Clearfield Communications
and it's not clear if they will continue to provide the serial console
parts. When I determine for sure, I'll update this page.</p>

<p>Kits, adapters, and cables are available for:
<a href="Cisco/ciscokit.html">Cisco and Lantronix</a>,
<a href="IOLAN/iolankit.html">IOLAN Rack+</a>,
<a href="Xyplex/xyplexkit.html">Xyplex 1600 and iTouch
In-Reach</a>,
and <a href="Annex/annexkit.html">Xylogics Annex - Bay
Networks - Nortel</a></p>

<p>By default, the adapters for each of the different RJ-45 wiring
schemes are shipped with different case colors, so that they will be
easier to identify in larger installations which support multiple
vendors devices. But, you can specify a case color when you order, if
you desire.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a> also adopted a labeling
scheme that includes a reference to the wiring scheme, as well as
gender and DCE/DTE wiring, so that colorblind individuals can tell
which RJ-45 wiring scheme is used on any given cable or adapter. (You
can get more information, or order parts, by contacting
1-800-422-2537. Steve Vacik has been helpful in the past, but any of
the sales folks should be able to help if you give them the part
number(s) from the adapter kit pages listed above.)</p>
