<h2>
<center>My Serial Doctor Bag</center>

</h2>

<h4 align="center">http://www.conserver.com/consoles/MyDoctorBag/doctorbag.html<br>

(updated:Sunday, 06-Jan-2008 22:41:26 PST )</h4>

<p>As I've worked in different networks, I've worked with various
terminal servers and console servers. Each vendor had a different
RJ-45 wiring format, so each shop had a different collection of
adapters from RJ-45 to DB9 and DB25. I used to keep a collection of
these adapters at my desk, so I would always have a couple of each
(in case someone had used the last of the adapter I needed to finish
a particular project). I also had my troubleshooting tools to carry.
</p>

<p>Initially, I used small, zippered bags. The best I had found
were
for the Telebit Q-Blazer modem. Measuring about 2" x 3" x 4", with a
large, sturdy velcro straps in back, to hold the modem kit to the
strap of your laptop bag, these became my main storage device. I
managed to get a dozen of these, and I used one for my Cisco
adapters, one for my Annex adapters, one for my troubleshooting
tools, and another for assorted serial gender changers and
DB9-to-DB25 adapters. This was useful for many years.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2004, I bought a serial protocol analyzer,
and
this was very useful. As a result, I was carrying this everywhere. It
came in its own pouch, with a pocket for its AC power adapter,
cables, and serial adapters. I decided I needed something to carry
the analyzer, some key tools, and my troubleshooting tools. The
analyzer was the main object that would drive the size choice.</p>

<p>I tried luggage shops, laptop bags, tool cases, and even
plastic
storage tubs, but none of them were a good size fit, and most were
too bulky to carry easily. But I was always keeping one eye out for
the Right Bag. I finally found it at Orchard Supply Hardware, while
looking for leather work gloves.</p>

      <p>I like green, generally. And I don't mind the brand
being embroidered in bright red, since I consider myself to be a
'craftsman' in the art of serial communications.</p>

      <p>This is a sturdy bag, with exterior pockets (short
pockets, and even some mesh pockets...notice the AC Power Tester in the
lower left of the picture) and deeper interior pockets. There is also a
stiffened edge around the zippered opening, like your classic M.D.'s
"doctor's bag", which will hold the bag open wide when the zipper is
opened (which makes it easy to use both hands to get things in and out
of the bag!). I use the outside pockets for the tools that I need the
most often, and the tools that I need quickly, such as the AC
power/ground tester, RJ-45 cable continuity tester, and a few small
hand tools. </p>

      <p>The Paladin Patch-Check(tm) cable continuity checker is
one of my mainstay tools. I use it to tell me if a cable is wired the
way that I expect it to be. I made some labels that detail the
end-to-end wiring for some 'specialty' cables, and I attached them to
the continuity checker for quick reference. (I have a set of matching
stickers inside the case of my AMP cable making toolkit, but I don't
carry that crimping kit in this bag.)</p>

</p>

<p>This continuity checker has saved me <b>so many times</b>,
by
spotting a short, an intermittent open, or a mis-wired cable. I
don't need to 'certify' a cable for CAT-5 compatability, but I
<b>do</b> need to know where the wires are going.</p>

<p>Another use for this device is to tell me the end-to-end
wiring
when I've got a working chain of cables and adapters! So many devices
with an RJ-45 serial port will have a specialty cable, RJ-45 to
some DB-type adapter...but it wasn't long enough, or it was the
wrong DB connector, or the wrong DCE/DTE signalling...so, other
adapters or cables were needed to make a connection work. In these
cases, I'll unplug the two ends, and use this tracer to show me the
pinout from one RJ-45 to the other.</p>

<p>For cases where there is an RJ-45 to a DB-type connector, I
can
still use this tracer, and a single trusted RJ45-to-DBx adapter and
one ethernet cable to test the cable. (I already know the ethernet
cable is a 'straight-through' cable, and I already know where all
eight signals on the ehternet cable will wind up when they pass
through the DB adapter). Then, all I need to do is use the tracer to
put a signal on each wire, and then read what wire(s) receive the
signal coming back into the continuity checker! Write it all down
in my notebook, and I've documented another cable without resorting to
surgery.</p>

<p>(I've also added a 'simpler' CAT-5 continuity checker, which
is a
master-and-remote type, for longer cable runs. This one only shows me
green LEDs for the four pairs, but it does confirm of the cable is
straight-through AT&amp;T 468B.)</p>

<p>I carry two USB serial dongles, bacause they show up (by
default)
as different COM ports on a PC. If one isn't recognized by a given
machine, the other one might be. If I decide I don't trust one, I have
a 'second opinion' in my bag. The dark grey device is an <a href="http://www.iogear.com/main.php?loc=product&amp;Item=GUC232A">IO
Gear GUC232A</a>, which has a single yellow LED that indicates TD
activity (from USB to serial). The blue devices is something I found
on the <a href="http://www.scannersoft.com/accessories.htm">ScannerSoft</a>
website, and it has two LEDS, to indicate both TD and RD activity.
You can purchase the blue device (model <a href="">USBG-232</a>),
from <a href="http://www.usbgear.com/USB-Serial.html">www.USBGear.com</a>.</p>

Late in 2007, I broke down to buy a couple <a href="http://www.blueconsole.com/">BlueConsole</a>
bluetooth serial devices. These let me use my Treo 650 phone as a
terminal (using the <a href="http://www.tridone.com/">TriConnect
software</a>) with a bluetooth link to the BlueConsole device. I
have one DE9M and one DE9F, and a Cisco-wired RJ45 on the way. The DE9M
unit is shown here with 9-volt battery, and a Cisco DE9F adapter.<br>

<p><br>

Which serial adapter kit I carry largely depends on what type
of Console
Server I need to service. These days, I'm frequently connecting folks
to Cyclades devices. I've bought some 1-foot and 3-foot CAT-5 cables
from <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA Cables &amp;
Networks</a>,
specifying blue boots on grey cable, so that these cables stand out
from the crowd (because they are wired as Cyclades Crossover cables,
so I have a quick 'null-modem' connection if I don't have the right
Cyclades adapter in my bag).</p>

<ul>

  <p><i>I have similar bags for Cisco, Annex/Bay, a
full-blown Bay Networks collection, a Xyplex/iTouch/MRV bag, and an
IOLAN bag, as well as a few with Apple LocalTalk, a Q-Blazer modem, and
assorted serial adapters.</i></p>

</ul>

<p>The black cable with the green boots is my 'trusted' crossover
ethernet cable (because all 'crossover' ethernet cables are NOT
wired the same, as my continuity checker will confirm!). The color
scheme was chosen at Synopsys, to make the crossover cables stand
out in a crowd. You can also see the white bands near the boots.
The bands are laminated labels, with a combination part number and
serial number, making it really easy to be sure that you are tracing
the correct cable on a long run. This cable is 3-feet long, but I
pay a bit more to get all of the cables with a serial number label.</p>

<p>Stealth Ports? Sometimes a port won't show you its signals
until
it sees something else conencted to it. This box helps me coax a shy
port into revealing itself. It is home-built, and battery-powered.
I use this in combination with a DB-9 <a href="../Tracers/tracers.html">passive RS-232 signal tracer</a>
to check the signals on stealth ports.
</p>

<p>Passive signal tracers are a must-have. I use them to confirm
that my adapters and cables are correct, because I start with a base of
knowledge (see my <a href="../msock.html">Minor Scroll of
Console
Knowledge</a>). Normally, I don't need a Break-Out Box, or the
ability
to change the leads of an adapter in the field. I also carry a
collection
of gender changers and adapters, only for troubleshooting. When you
need to get the connection working, and you may not have the correct
adapter in sufficient quantities, sometimes you need to be able to pull
a rabbit out of your hat. </p>

<p>(Not shown here are a few spare, unwired
DB-9 male and female RJ-45 adapters. Once in a while, I need to wire
up something special, and these can be invaluable, saving me a trip
to Fry's after hours, when building access might be a problem.)
</p>

<ul>

  <p><i><font color="teal">As a rule, I hate
chaining extra adapters together. They become another potential point
of failure (disconnect, or intermitent). The added weight can bend the
contacts on the connected equipment, making them intermitent. The extra
size can make the adapter chain stick out farther from the equipment,
making it more vulnerable to coming in contact with someone working
near the equipment (resulting in some amount of breakage). As a
long-term solution, you should put in a single cable, with the proper
connectors, and screw the connectors down when you have that option.</font></i></p>

  <i><font color="teal"> </font></i>
  <p><i><font color="teal">That said; for the
short term, sometimes you need to 'fudge', in order to make it work in
a short amount of time. I've bought a variety of small (read:
lightweight, and low profile) adapters for this task. They minimize the
risks above, and let me get the connection working. <b>BUT</b>,
when the connection is working, I also then know what parts are really
needed to do the job <b>correctly</b>, and I know what the
end-to-end conenctions of the cable need to be, so I can make an
appropriate cable (or acquire the correct adapters) and schedule a time
to swap the <b>correct</b> parts or cable in, and retrieve
my adapters.</font></i></p>

      <p>Also in the main compartment of my Doctors Bag is my
Serial Protocol Analyzer bag. This is a model <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/d200spec.htm">DLM-200</a>,
from <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/index.htm">Benedict
Computing</a>, in Menlo Park, CA.</p>

      <p>The lower compartment houses the protocol analyzer,
while the upper pouch carries all of the extra parts that came with it.</p>

      <p>I didn't expect to buy a full-featured tool like this.
However, I'm quite happy with this purchase. Because I have some of the
extra features in a portable, stand-alone device, I use it more often
than I thought that I would</p>

</p>

<p>It was extremely useful during the rebuilding of my serial
devices database, letting me check for port speeds and parity, while I
was checking the signals to re-add them to the database. When I had the
time available, I would use the auto-baud feature of the DLM, and
let it detect traffic from the devices, telling me what speed the
port was using.
</p>

<p>Another benefit to having the DLM was to watch a conversation
on
the serial port, as a bi-directional sniffer. The advantage of this
method, versus using a terminal emulator, is that you can either
watch the two data leads in relation to each other, or you can
also get the data displayed with the logic state of the hardware
flow control and handshaking leads! This is invaluable when working
with modems, in looking for data loss in buffers, nortmally related
to flow control, or when the DCD function is mapped to the hardware
leads as well. Sometimes, software implementations don't always
match what the manual says they will do, and the DLM shows you
what is really happening.
</p>

<p>Here's a look at the analyzer, and the supporting accessories
that
fit in the outside pouch of the analyzer bag...<br>

<table border="0" width="100%">

      <td>
      <ol>

        <li>male-DB9-to-female-DB25 and female-DB9-to-male-DB25
adapters </li>

        <li>male and female Cisco-schema DB9 adapters (I added
these...) </li>

        <li>a 25-lead ribbon cable, with male and female DB25
connectors on each end. (This is to let you 'insert' the analyzer in
between a device and it's attached cable.) </li>

        <li>A handy passive break-out box, which lets me pass
through any signals, or block them (and use the black jumpers to
cross-wire other signals). </li>

        <li>The AC Power Supply (wall-wart) for the DLM-200. The
unit runs on batteries, and the power pack charges the unit. </li>

        <li>The manual for the unit is stored in a plastic pouch
in the 'middle' of the pouch body. </li>

      </ol>

      </td>

      <td width="380">
      <p><img src="DrBag-07.jpg" x-sas-useimagewidth="" x-sas-useimageheight="" align="bottom" height="281" width="372"> </p>

      </td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

</p>

<p>I rarely use the wall wart power pack, except to charge the
unit.
I do use the PS if I think I'm going to have the unit powered for
a couple hours (to preserve the battery for when I want to run the
DLM without a leash). I haven't used half of the features (yet),
but I do sit down with the manual every month or two, and try to
learn about another feature.
</p>

<p>The DB25 ribbon cable makes it easy to put the analyzer "in
between" two other devices. While you <i>could</i> use two
longer cables to extend the data leads to the DB25 male and female
connectors on the right-hand side of the DLM, it's easier to use the
ribbon cable to connect between a device and it's connector, and
then plug the other end of the ribbon cable into the DLM. (And, since
the DLM has the DB25 connectors on the side, you can use the DB25
ribbon
cable, with the two DB9-to-DB25 adapters on the other end, if you
needed to get "in between" on a DB9 connection.)
</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the analyzer. The case color is
different
than the <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/d200spec.htm">production
models.</a> I added some labeling of my own, as a reminder of
which ports did what.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img src="DrBag-08.jpg" x-sas-useimagewidth="" x-sas-useimageheight="" align="bottom" height="266" width="427"></center>

<p></p>

<p>Yes, the DLM-200 has a Parallel port, as well as the DTE and
DCE RS-232 serial ports! I could print the reports, if I had a
parallel printer. But I can also exercise a parallel connection.
(The Benedict products are really versatile!) The rechargeable
batteries inside have been holding up well. They also use the LARGEST
button cell that I've ever seen for backing up the memory.
(Luckily, I can buy these big button cells at Long's Drugstore,
in the watches/photo/battery counter! They are not available at
the local Radio Shack, but they are at Long's! Who would have guessed?)</p>
