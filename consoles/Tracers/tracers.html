<p>Beyond these three, there are some images and ramblings about an
RJ-45 signal tracer that I'm cobbling together, and some artwork about
using the signal tracer.

<P>My <B>DataTran</B> signal tracers are a vital troubleshooting tool
for me, and they have earned their place in
<A HREF="../MyDoctorBag/doctorbag.html">my Doctor Bag</A>. I wish they
were still in business, so that they could make these RJ-45 tracers!
(I wish I could find permission (and the plastic case molds) to make more 
of their DE-9 and DB-25 tracers...)

         </UL>
         
         <P>This is a device, meant for looking at RS-232 signal
         levels. Because there are no batteries, the power for the
         display is derived from the signal leads. One benefit of
         this, is that you can usually see a low-voltage condition,
         which could be one cause for communications problems.
         However, drawing power from the signal leads can cause a
         drop in the signal voltages, so you cannot use these devices
         in the 'fringe cases'. (If your signal path is at the limits
         of length, or drive power, you may see a degradation of data
         when you insert a signal tracer.)
         
         <P>Because they don't have batteries, a <I>passive signal
         tracer</I> is usually smaller and lighter than a Break-Out
         Box.
         
         <P>Because there are no active components, these devices
         don't have the intelligence to monitor the data on the wire.
         A <I>passive signal tracer</I> is <B>NOT</B> a <B>serial
         protocol analyzer</B>, or a <B>serial data tap</B> device.
         
         <P>Because a <I>passive signal tracer</I> does not emit a
         signal, it is <B>NOT</B> a <B>cable tracer</B>, or a
         <B>cable analyzer</B>.
         
         <P>The signals (voltage levels) for RS-232 are different
         from the signals for Ethernet, Token Ring, and most other
         data interchange interfaces, so a <I>passive signal
         tracer</I> is <B>NOT</B> an <B>Ethernet Link Checker</B>.
         
         <P><CENTER>A <I>passive signal tracer</I> is designed to
         troubleshoot at the <B><I>Physical-Layer</I></B>.</CENTER>
         
         <P>When you are following a cable through a 'rats nest',
         under a data center floor, or across a hanging ceiling,
         sometimes you can make a mistake, and wind up following the
         wrong cable. When you get to the "other end", a <I>passive
         signal tracer</I> will let you see if you've still got an
         RS-232 signal, and with some simple testing, you can
         determine if this is the cable that you think it is.
         
         <UL>
            <LI>A <I>passive signal tracer</I> doesn't normally have
            any switches or jumpers.
            
            <LI>A <I>passive signal tracer</I> won't automatically
            match the signals between two RS-232 cables.
            
            <LI>A <I>passive signal tracer</I> is meant for momentary
            troubleshooting, and is not left <I>in-line</I>.
         </UL>

         <p>A <B>breakout box</B> is a device that lets you view the
         logic state of many, or all, of the signal leads, as well as
         providing some ability to interrupt some (or all) of the signal
         leads. Sometimes these devices need batteries to function. 
         The access to the signal leads allows you to pass-through, 
         disconnect, or cross-connect leads from one connector to 
         another with jumper wires. The intention of a breakout box is
         to allow you to monitor the signals, and also simulate the
         adapter or cable that you need. However, I often find that
         breakout boxes are often left in service, rather than being
         replaced by the appropriate adapter(s) or custom cable. If
         the breakout box is allowed to hang freely, the weight of
         the breakout box can cause damage to the pins on the
         connectors (of the breakout box and the equipment it is
         hanging from), leading to reliability problems later on.

         <p><b>One Breakout Box that I like</b> is available from
         <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/boball.htm">Benedict
         Communications</a>. The 
         <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/boball.htm#BOB-100">BOB-100</a>
         is a low-profile device, and the LEDs and switches lie below
         the surface of the device. It has the ability to use an external
         9-volt battery to provide +/- signals to stimulate signal leads,
         but you don't need to have the battery for most funtions. The
         unit also can test <b>Current Loop</b> interfaces! While I also
         like the ability to use the triggers (found on the 
         <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/100dclos.htm">BOB-100 Deluxe</a>),
         but the larger size outweighed my occassional need for a trap.
         However, it's still a much nicer package than most that I've
         worked with to date.
         
         <P>I prefer the <B>Passive Signal Tracer</B>. It is much
         smaller, and cheaper, than a Breakout Box, and I find that
         the signal tracer tells me all I need to know to establish
         the physical RS-232 link on DB-25 and DB-9 connections. It
         gives me a good clue if I have a reasonable cable, or (if
         the signals appear on strange pins) whether the cable may be
         wired strangely. It can tell me if an RJ-45 to DB-25 adapter
         is DTE or DCE, or (if the signals appear on strange pins)
         maybe the adapter isn't built with the RJ-45 wiring that I
         need.

         <P>While the signal tracer won't automatically make the
         connection work if I have the wrong cable or adapter in
         place, it does gives me a quick, visual indication that I
         have the right or wrong parts. The signal tracer lets me see
         what "normal", working circuits look like, which lets me
         spot the abnormal conditions when they occur. The lights are
         the clues to what isn't right, and they tell me what to
         check next to resolve the interface conflict.
         
         <P>If you are trying to connect two devices, your main clues
         lie with <B>pins 2 &amp; 3</B> on the DB-25 and DE-9
         connectors. It really doesn't matter which pins are used to
         transmit and receive. The secret is knowing which pin is the
         transmitter from each device, and which is the receiver. The
         signal monitor will tell you this.(This is because you will
         need to tie the transmitter on one device to the receiver of
         the other device in order for traffic to pass, right?)

         <P>There is a good description of how to select a pair of
         RJ-45 to DB-type connectors to connect two serial ports on
         the <A HREF="../msock.html#simple">Minor Scroll</A> page, as
         well as showing how to use a passive signal tracer to
         confirm that the connectors were the correct choice.
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>The animated image below will show you how you can use a Passive
Signal Tracer to connect to a serial port to check whether the transmit
data is on pin 2 or pin 3, and then check the cable to see if you have
the correct adapter (by looking for transmit data on the cable, before
you try to connect the cables).

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="tracer-howto.gif" WIDTH=474 HEIGHT=237
ALIGN=bottom></CENTER>

<P>You can insert a passive signal tracer into a working serial
connection, and watch the signals while the connection is working.
The tracer can show you what "normal" looks like. Does the
handshaking leads change state? Is the flow control ever invoked? How
'regular' or how 'bursty' is the data? Is it more in one direction
than the other? Troubleshooting a system is easier when you know what
the signals look like when the system is working.

<P>When you are trying to troubleshoot a connection, you usually need
to start with an understanding of how the physical connection is
made, and what signals are connected. If you already have an idea how
the connection is built, you can use the signal tracer to confirm
what you already know. (Sometimes, the tracer will show you that the
connection is NOT built the way you expected! Maybe you were wrong,
or maybe someone changed it after you knew how it was built...but the
tracer can show you how it is built NOW.)

<P>If you don't know how the connection is built, you can use the
signal tracer to find out. By inserting the passive signal tracer in
the connection path at various points, you can determine if there is
a wiring problem, and locate the failure between two connectors.

<P>While a passive signal tracer doesn't allow you to make a special
connection (like a Break-out Box would), it will show you what
signals are present, so you can decide if the connection will work.

         <P>To start off, I think that the <B>DataTran</B> folks 'had
         it right' when they designed their <B>Mini-Tracker</B> line
         of passive RS-232 signal tracers. As a company, DataTran
         died off, and it's nearly impossible to find their devices
         anymore. But, the tracers that I bought in the mid-80's are
         STILL in <A HREF="../MyDoctorBag/doctorbag.html">my doctor
         bag</A> or my pocket, working every week. They are rugged,
         reliable, small and light. Because of this, the Mini-Tracker
         family are what I use to measure all the other passive signal
         tracers that I see. I've also recently purchased a
         <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/boball.htm#BOB-100">BOB-100</a>
         from <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/">Benedict
         Communications, because of it's low-profile design, and it's
         ability to be used without a battery, for those few occassions
         when I want to try to make a connection work BEFORE I've
         made a proper cable or adapter.

         <p>The rest of this section is devoted to showing you what I 
         think are the good and bad aspects and features of passive
         RS-232 signal tracers. (The <b>BOB-100</b> and the <b>Black Box</b>
         devices meet most of these criteria. The BOB-100 costs about 
         twice the price ofe the Black Box signal tracer, but it also
         provides the Break-out Box funtionality.)

<P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%">
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P><B>Look for a tracer that uses two separate LEDs for each
         signal lead</B>
         
         <P>This is a personal preference, I admit, but it comes from
         practical needs. Primarily, you have three signal conditions
         that you need to monitor (no signal, positive voltage, and
         negative voltage, in reference to the signal reference
         ground). You cannot do that with a single LED, as shown in
         the illustration at the right.
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">When the signal lead
         is more positive than the reference signal, the single RED LED
         will light. (The single red LED cannot tell you if the signal 
         is more negative than the reference signal, or if the signal is
         simply not there, because the red LED will be dark in
         either case.)</FONT></I>
         </BLOCKQUOTE>
         
         <P>A Bi-Color LED has two LED elements in the same device,
         biased in opposite directions. You pick which LED will light
         based on the polarity of the power applied. With this device,
         RED indicates one polarity, and GREEN indicates the other,
         while a dark LED indicates no signal at all. (A 'yellow' or
         'orange' color indicates that the polarity is alternating
         rapidly.)
         
         <P>Back in the 300-2400 bits-per-second data days, it was
         easy enough to notice when a bi-color LED was in a steady
         red or green, and when it was flickering to a different
         shade because of data transitions. But, with 'normal' speeds
         set at 9600 bps and above, it's nearly impossible to see the
         transitions of a character or two. Don't waste your time
         looking at a bi-color LED with data speeds of 57.6 Kbps and
         above.

<P><TABLE BORDER=0>
   <TR>
      <TD>
      <P>It is much easier to 'see' high-speed data with two LEDs, 
      because the 'idle' state is shown on one LED, while the data 
      becomes a flicker on the second LED. Even with brief 
      transitions of one or two characters, you can see the faint 
      flicker on the second LED. (You may need to block your view 
      of the first LED if it is really bright, using a finger, 
      if you are looking for really fast/brief data.)

</TABLE>

<P>It's easier to notice when the second LED blinks if it is a
different color than the first LED. If the manufacturer used the same
color for all of the LEDs, consider finding another product.

<P>With most Bi-Color LEDs, the body plastic of the LED is usually a
'water clear' (transparent, no color), or a 'clear diffused
(translucent, milky-white). Unless you read the product
specifications, you can't be sure if it is a bi-color part, or if it
is a single color part. When you buy a device that uses two separate
colored LEDs, the body plastic of the LEDs is usually colored, making
it easy to see that you are getting different color LEDs.</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=0>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P><B>The LEDs should NOT extend above the surface of the
         case</B>
         
         <P>This is where most of the cheap signal tracers will fail
         you. The pictures at the right are examples of the typical
         offering that I find when I'm shopping for signal tracers. I
         think this type of construction is '<I>Bad</I>', and I think
         that they should be avoided.</P>
         
         <P>When the LEDs stick out of the case like this, the device
         becomes vulnerable to early failure of circuit board (broken
         solders, or 'popped' traces).

         <P><img src="DB9-tracer-bicolor.jpg">

</TABLE>

<P>Whether it's pressure from being in your pocket, carried in your 
hands with other tools and equipment, or floating around in your tool 
bag, pressure can be directly applied to the case of the LEDs, and 
this pressure normally pushes down against the underlying circuit 
board. If the pressure is relatively even on both leads, you may 
only cause the solder pad to lift away from the circuit board inside. 
If the pressure causes more pressure against one lead than the
other, it can cause a fracture of the plastic body of the LED.</P>
         
<P>When a signal tracer becomes unreliable, it is no longer valuable. 
If you are going to consider buying this type of tracer, you should 
also consider whether you will be able to open the case plastic later, 
so you can try to repair it. If the case is glued or molded, and the 
LEDs stick out, I recommend passing up on that purchase. (Even if you 
don't get paid for your time, an unreliable tool will frustrate you, 
and make your troubleshooting harder, and it will take longer. Save 
your money, and keep looking!)

<P>DataTran used LEDs that were mounted 'flush', sitting directly on
the circuit board, so that you couldn't push them down any farther.
(This technique required careful soldering, as the short leads would
transmit the heat from soldering to the LED body quickly. But this
attention is one of the strengths of the DataTran design, because
it's very hard to pop a trace on them!)

<P><A HREF="http://www.blackbox.com/">Black Box Co</A>. also offers a
product, made in France, that keeps the LEDs safe from harm. The
Black Box <B>Quick Test-RS232</B> (p/n 724-746-5500) keeps the LEDs
under a plastic overlay with silkscreen printing. You can see the
LEDs under the plastic label. This device is larger than the largest
DataTran Mini-Tracker was, and is at a higher cost. However, it also
comes with a set of DB9-to-DB25 mini-adapters, making it easy to use
it for DB9 or DB25 connections.</P>

         <P><B>The LEDs should have a wide viewing angle</B></P>
         
         <P>This becomes a bit harder, if the LEDs are kept within
         the body of the tracer. Again, it's a case where I think the
         DataTran design is still the heads-up winner! The reason for
         this was their choice of components (ROHM LEDs, I believe),
         as well as the choice to NOT have a label above the LEDs.
         </P>

         and 511-1228-ND respectively) have an
         oval-ish contour (as viewed from above), instead of the
         usual round design. This allowed the designer to put the
         LEDs closer together. But these LEDs also have a nice wide
         viewing angle.
         
         <P>In this case, the label on the Black Box tracer works
         against the user. The plastic label has a mask on the
         underside of the label, which limits the amount of light
         that escapes, so it is difficult to see the signals at a
         severe angle. The mask can sometimes reflect glare from
         other ligths nearby, obscuring the view of the LEDs.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/bob100.htm">BOB-100</a>

         <P>With single Rack Unit-tall devices showing up more
         frequently, I often find myself needing to look at signals
         of a shallow chassis, buried between a couple deeper
         chassis. It's nearly impossible to read a tracer at such a
         steep angle, so I always have a couple of ribbon cable DB
         extension cables. The cable is 18 inches long, with a male
         connector on one end, and a female connector on the other. I
         have one for DB-9, and one for DB-25. No matter which gender
         I need, these cables will let me use the tracer beyond the
         shadow of the deeper chassis, and the connector gender at 
         the tracer will be the same as the connector on the port 
         under test (so it is a good reminder of the gender the 
         connector on the chassis).

         <p><b>What's inside your average tracer?</b>

         <p>As described above, there is usually an LED, connected to each
         of the signal leads being monitored. There is usually a small
         resistor in series with the LED, to limit the current and reduce
         the signal voltage through the LED. (And, in a good tracer, there
         will be two LEDs on each lead, sharing a single resistor.) The 
         to the right shows you a basic schematic for a &quot;good&quot;
         passive signal tracer.

         <p>The resistor pack shown is XICOM Part number 265-1.2K
         (<a href="http://www.jameco.com/">JAMECO</a> part 276091), but
         they can also be 1/8-watt, 10% carbon-composition resistors.
         The value of 1.2k was determined by testing the LEDs I was
         using for good brightness at 12 volts DC, since some LEDs
         are brighter or darker at any given current.

         <p>Some tracers will only monitor a couple leads, while
         some monitor the &quot;Big Six&quot; (TD, RD, RTS, CTS,
         DTR, and DSR), while others will include DCD, and even
         RI (Ring Indicator). Add the pin numbers for your favorite
         RS-232 interface...

         <p>The LEDs here are reverse-polarity from each other.
         If the tracer uses bi-color LEDs, the schematic is basically
         the same, because the two-lead bi-color LED has the two LED
         components inside in this same reverse-polarity orientation.

         <p><b>Make SURE you know where your signal ground is!</b> This
         schematic is getting the common ground for the signals from 
         pin 4 of the RJ-45 connector. If you are adapting the schematic
         for your own use, make sure you connect the common side of
         the resistors to the signal ground of your device!</p>

         <p>I've cobbled together an RJ-45 tracer, for use with Cisco, 
         Cyclades, Xyplex (iTouch, MRV) and others. The main reliance 
         is that the signal ground is on pin 4 of the RJ-45, and a 
         switch is used to connect ground to pin 5 for use with Cisco 
         devices.</p>

         <p>The modified schematic is shown to the right, and includes a
         switch (S-1). The pins are labeled for the RJ-45 pins. The switch
         I picked was a DPDT DIP switch, just because of the form factor
         (about as wide as the LEDs, and could be mounted flush with
         the case, so that the switch handle doesn't get broken off)

         <ul><i>The orientation of the poles of the switch are important!
            The 'common' pole of the switch must be connected to pin 5 of
            the RJ-45, to ensure that pin 5 is connected to ground <b>or</b>
            to the LEDs for pin 5...</i>
         </ul>

         <p>The first prototype worked well, but I couldn't find a
         small cable interconnect to use. (Consider how thin the device
         could be if I wanted to solder the RJ-45 cables to the board!)

<a name="homemade"></a><p>The pictures below show the first prototype,
on perf-board, and hand-soldered. You can see how well the DIP switch 
lined up vertically with the LEDs, and you can also see the density 
of these 'oval' <b>ROHM</b> LEDs.

         <p>Once the first prototype passed the initial testing in 
         service, I decided to make the second prototype, raising the 
         LEDs and the switch to extend up to be flush with the case 
         (due to the height of the insulation-displacement connector 
         I had picked for the cable connection).</p>

         <p>With the RJ-45 cable as a pass-through, you can plug the
         tracer easily into RJ-45 adapters, or into connections on
         the Console Servers or RJ-45 patch panels.</p>

         <p>The switch sits flush with the case, and should not be
         easily changed 'by accident'. The LEDs are protected from
         pressure by the case, and the case is also holding the
         cable interconnect on its pins (preventing the connector
         from coming loose).</p>

         <p>The pigtail cable soming from either end makes it easy
         to add an RJ-45 cable coupler. This helps to protect the
         RJ-45 connectors when it's not in use, and also makes it
         easy to add the tracer in-line easily for quick monitoring
         of active consoles.</p>

         <p>The image to the left shows the first prototype, next to an
         old tracer I built to monitor RS-232 signals using the Mini-DIN-8
         connector used on Apple Macintosh (and SGI) computers.)</p>
   
         <p>The size of the case used on the Mac tracer was similar in size
         to the box used for the second RJ-45 prototype, as an example of
         the scale in the photo.</P>

         <p>The Mac only has one pair of in/out control leads, besides the
         TD/RD pair. This allows for either Flow Control <b>or</b>
         hardware handshaking, but not both (which is why there are only 
         4 pairs of LEDs).</p>

         <p>I found an in-line female Mini-DIN-8 connector, so I used that
         on the cable, instead of building a board- or chassis-mounted
         connector into the case (to keep the case size small).</p>
