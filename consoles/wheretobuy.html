<h2>
<center>Where to buy Console Adapters and Cables</center>

Back when I was starting these pages, I began working at Synopsys, and
we would buy Ethernet cables with serial number labels on each end. The
cables were also color-coded to the networks, and for serial consoles.
The serial number encoded the color, length wiring diagram, and a
unique serial number. I bought them from Americable, which later merged
to become <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA Cables and
Networks</a> (<a href="http://www.apacn.com/">apacn.com</a>).
<br>


<br>


You can see some pictures of my handiwork in chapter 6 of the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-System-Network-Administration-2nd/dp/0321492668/ref=sr_1_1/104-7551476-3333529?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193371903&amp;sr=8-1">The
Practice of System and Network Administration</a>", by Thomas A.
Limoncelli, Christina J. Hogan, and Strata R. Chalup, published by
Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-321-49266-8.<br>


<br>


I worked with Steve Vacik, to develop the schematics for various
adapters for a variety of console servers. This was a benefit for many
large data centers. I still recommend APACN (Steve is still there) for
folks who can buy in larger quantities.<br>


<br>


Finding a source for cables and adapters for smaller quantities, who
will accept credit cards or PayPal for transactions, has been MUCH more
difficult. Some companies will say they are selling a Cisco or Cyclades
adapter, but they are unwilling to confirm the wiring inside, so I
cannot be sure, and so I cannot recommend any (so far). As a result,
I've been putting more adapter schematics on the website, so that you
can make the few that you might need. But if you have more than 25
adapters to make, I still encourage you to find a good vendor, and have
them make them, and label them. You'll thank me later.
<p>If you find any errors on these pages, have comments for me,
or if
you have additional information that you feel that I could include,
please send email to <b>consoles</b> at <b>conserver.com</b>.
Are you
curious <a href="about.html">why I do keep up these pages?</a>
I've also started a <a href="http://consoleteam.blogspot.com/">ConsoleTeam
blog</a>, as a place to put ideas for which I'm not ready to
create a dedicated page.</p>

<p>Digi sells most their adapters through CDW, in packs of 8. Use
the
Digi part numbers (when given) to search for the 8-pack items on the
CDW pages.</p>

If you need to buy in large quantites, Clearfield Communications can
provide any of these
adapters, and any of the cables in any lengths you want, even if there
isn't an equivalent APACN part number listed on my pages. They can also
pre-lable the cables with unique serial numbers, which has been
especially helpful for me. <br>


<br>


Steve Vacik also created some "Adapter Kits", which included one of a
variety of adapters, and some cables, as a way to equip field
technicians with a ready set of adapters for a particular vendor. These
kits are detailed below.<br>

<h3> <a name="cyclades"></a><a href="http://www.cdw.com/">Cyclades, Avocent</a>&nbsp;</h3>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">800.750.4239</span>
<p>The Cyclades part ID convention is that the prefix ADB means an
adapter (an RJ45 female and the appropriate DB or DE connector), while
&nbsp;CAB means an RJ45 male connector on a roughly 3YY' "silver
satin"-type cable to the appropriate DB or DE connector. &nbsp;The
numeric part of the number indicates the wiring, and the DB or DE
connector type. (So, a CAB0036 and an ADB0036 would have the same
schematic, if you use a straight-through Ethernet cable on the
ADB0036.) &nbsp;They seem to use "Cross" when they are making the DB/DE
connector a DCE interface, and "Straight" means the DB/DE connector
will look like a DTE interface. The word "converter" means an adapter.</p>
Not all adapters have a cable equivalent from Avocent. There are the
parts that I've been able to order in the past. I'm not sure if Avocent
may be adding or subtracting from this list.<br>
