    were moved, as part of a website upgrade. I'm sorry for 
    any trouble this may cause, but I felt it was important to 
    restructure the website to allow for more growth, and leaving 
    me better able to manage the site.  I hope you will bookmark 
    the new page, and check back regularly.  Thanks for checking 
    in.  -Zonker-</h5></p>
