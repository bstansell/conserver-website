<h4><center>http://www.conserver.com/consoles/Cisco/ciscocons.html<br>(updated:

<p>This document will outline terminal server connections to Cisco terminal server 
devices (namely the 2509-11 products), as well as any of the Access Products family 
that use the NM-16A, NM-32A async modules (such as some of the 2600 and 3600 family 
products), or the HWIC-8A and/or HWIC-16A Async interface cards (such as the 1800, 2800,
and 3800 series devices, and the 1900 and 2900 ISR families). These connections use 
the Cisco-defined signal pinouts for the RJ-45 connector. All connections presume that 
you area using either a Cisco "Hydra" cable (to male RJ-45 connectors), the built-in 
RJ-45 Console or AUX ports, or you are using a Cisco-wiring-scheme
<a href="#patch">patch panel</a>, connected to the high-density connectors on the 
terminal servers (or NMs), with connections configured as shown below. All connections 
make use of standard Ethernet cables (RJ-45, 8-conductor, 'straight through' cables)
unless specified otherwise.</p>

      <p>The older Cisco <b>CS-500</b> was a terminal server with 8-port and 16-port 
      versions, using an 8-wire RJ-45 female connector. </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Oddly enough, the production CS-500 didn't have adedicated console port. 
        Only the CS-500 units built for engineering development had a separate "console", 
        and that port was an <b>RJ-13</b>, 6-wire interface (which shared the same 
        pinouts as the ports on the older Cisco AGS/CGS/IGS routers and the Cisco ASM 
        terminal server), while the remaining async ports used what has become the 
        Cisco RJ-45 console interface.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>On Cisco devices that have an RJ-45 "Console" or "Aux" port, those RJ-45 ports 
      also use the same wiring pinouts, and so they can also use the same adapters. 
      The table below shows the signal information for both the Cisco RJ-45 Console 
      and Aux ports (considered to be wired as DTE), as well as the Cisco Patch Panel 
      solutions (which are considered to be wired as DCE) </p>

      <p>Notes:<br>
      1) <b>Input</b> means a signal <b>from</b> the external device, coming <b>in 
      to</b> the <b>RJ-45 connection.</b><br>
      2) <b>Output</b> means a signal source <b>from</b> the <b>RJ-45 connection</b>, 
      going <b>out to</b> the external device. </p>

      <p>The reference ground, and data signals, are located on the center pairs of 
      the RJ-45, so you can use a straight-through RJ-11 cable for simple, data-only 
      connections. (However, you should not use RJ-11 or RJ-12 connectors in your RJ-45
      jacks for longer than short tests, as these smaller connectors will tend to bend 
      the outer RJ-45 pins up, and this can lead to intermittent or open connections 
      on the RJ-45 jack later on, affecting the hardware flow control and hardware
      handshaking leads.)</p>

      <p>It's also important to note that not ALL Cisco devices with an RJ-45 console 
      and/or aux jack implement all of the signals. When Cisco acquired various hardware 
      lines, they made an effort to implement the RJ-45 serial schema. But, for example, 
      if that hardware platform only implemented the data lines, Cisco wouldn't try to 
      add the flow control or handshaking signals. (In the case of the Arrowpoint CSS 
      Load Balancer products, they used an existing RJ-45 wiring schema, not the Cisco 
      version, so early Cisco versions had this non-Cisco RJ45 pinout. See the Cisco 
      CS11555 pinouts on my <a href="../Signals/signals.html">Signals page</a>. </p>

The <span style="font-weight: bold;">RJ-45 Console</span> and 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aux</span> ports on many
Cisco devices will send serial BREAK when the device loses power. If
you have connected these console/aux ports to a Sun TTY port for
control of the Cisco, it's probable that the Sun will be halted when
the power to the Cisco device is lost, leaving you without a good
method to remotely access the Cisco. It would be better to monitor your
Cisco RJ45 console and aux ports with some other device, such as a
console server or access server instead.</span></p>

      for remotely connecting to their ports;
      <ul>
        <li><b>2000+line number</b> for the normal (7-bit) Telnet-like session
        <li><b>4000+line number</b> for an 8-bit-escapable session
        <li><b>6000+line number</b> for an 8-bit non-escapable session
      </ul></p>

      <p>The TCP-200n range mimics the normal Telnet session, passing
      7-bit data normally. This is typically what you will use if you
      are connecting remotely to device consoles for remote control.</p>

      <p>The TCP-400n range is used if you need to pass 8-bit data, 
      but you still need to be able to define an Escape character so 
      that you can drop the session when you are ready. You would use
      this when your sessions use PC-type graphics characters (the
      128-254 (decimal) character set used on Western keyboards).</p>

      <p>The TCP-600n range is reserved for sessions where you need a
      complete 8-bit binary path over the serial connection. You would
      require this if you need to use the console to transfer files
      using a binary protocol such as XMODEM. The disadvantage to this
      range is that you lose control of the session once you start it,
      and the device you are connecting to must then use hardware
      handshaking to signal the Cisco to disconenct the session.
      <ul>
        <li>Because you need EVERY byte in the data path, you can't
         reserve an in-band character to invoke your escape from
         the connection.
        <li>The serially-connected device you are communicating with
         will need to toggle the state of its DTR output (so that 
         the Cisco sees the change on its DSR input...so you need
         to invoke Modem Control).
        <li>If you cannot get the remote device to send the signal, 
         your only other option is to <b>clear</b> the line from
         the Cisco console, at the Enabled prompt.
      </ul></p>

      <p>Because of the symmetrical wiring schema used by Cisco for their RJ-45 consoles, 
      the best way to make a null-modem connection between two Cisco-schema RJ-45 
      consoles is to use a CAB-500 'rolled' 8-wire cable (see the diagram below). Note 
      that a Crossover Ethernet cable will NOT work. If you don't understand why, follow 
      the wires, and you'll see how the signals get misconnected... </p>

      <p>Standard Ethernet cables follow a specific wiring pattern. However, not ALL 
      Ethernet cables have 8 wires in the cable, since a standard basic Ethernet interface 
      only uses 4 of the wires. For console connections, you need to make sure that your 
      cables have <b>all 8 wires</b>, either 'straight through' (as shown to the left) for
      most connections, or 'rolled' (as shown in the center). The USOC cable used for 
      CDDI connections will also work as a 'rolled' cable, if you have them in the 
      appropriate lengths. </p>

      <p>If you need to connect devices over a longer distance
than your CAB-500, you can use standard 8-wire 'straight through'
(Ethernet) cables and a pair of Cisco-schema DB adapters to make the
null-modem signal transition. </p>

      <p>The four charts below show you how to use adapters to
make a Null Modem, using standard Ethernet cables to provide the
appropriate lengths. Always match vendor-compatible parts when you are
making null-modem connections! That is, always connect a Cisco-schema
adapter to another Cisco-schema adapter, MOD-TAP with MOD-TAP, etc., to
ensure that the wiring is correct from one end to the other. Your
connection will not work (or, if it works, it will likely not work
completely) if you mix adapters with different wiring schema.) </p>

      <p>To connect most Cisco console ports to another Cisco console port, use a 
      '<a href="#ethernet">rolled</a>' (8-wire) cable. </p>

      <p>Due to the nature of Cisco acquiring other companies, there are some devices 
      with a Cisco brand that use the Cisco RJ-45 wiring schema, but they do NOT use 
      all of the signals. That is, they may only use the Data leads, or they may not 
      use Hardware Handshaking. However, if they have converted to the RJ-45 connector, 
      they have also used the legacy wiring schema. I'm still on the lookout, in case 
      there is a Cisco product from an acquisition that uses the previous companies
      RJ-45 pinouts. </p>

      <p>In order to make it easier to connect various devices to Cisco console ports, 
      or to Cisco-schema patch panels, I've created my <a href="cisco-hosts.html">Cisco 
      Host-to-Adapters Page</a>, which lists the various devices on which I've checked 
      the serial interfaces. There are more than 500 devices in my connectivity
      database, and the adapter pages list the devices, and tells you which adapter (or 
      cable) you will need to connect each device to either a Cisco console port, or 
      to a <a href="#patch">patch panel</a>.
      </p>

      <p>There are a few Cisco devices that have RJ-45 consoles that are wired the 
      null-modem opposite from the Cisco wiring standard. The three devices listed 
      below were (I believe) Catalyst products. They are also listed on the 
      <a href="cisco-hosts.html">Cisco Host-to-Adapters Page</a>, with information 
      about which cable to use. (The RJ-45 wiring used on the console on these devices 
      appears to be a patch panel, and not a console port.) </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1100 switches </li>
        <li>1200 switches </li>
        <li>1400 switches </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cisco also sells an 8-cable "Hydra" interface (Cisco part <b>72-0845-01</b>) 
      from the 68-pin high-density connector to male RJ-45 connectors, having 3-foot 
      long leads. These can be used with the 68-pin connectors on the Cisco 2500-series 
      terminal servers, as well as the NM-16A and NM-32A async serial Network Modules.
      These cables have the same pinouts as an Ethernet cable plugged into the 
      <a href="#patch">Cisco Patch Panel</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <b><font color="#af0000">BEWARE: The Hydra cable will not work directly with 
        the 'different' devices listed above, because the consoles on those devices are 
        wired the 'null-modem' opposite from the regular Cisco RJ-45 console schema. 
        The Hydra cable was designed to connect to the normal console ports.</font></b>
      </ul>

      <p>The Cisco-schema <a href="#patch">patch panel</a> from APACN are wired the 
      null-modem opposite from theCisco console ports, so that a Cisco RJ-45 console 
      port can attach directly to a Cisco patch panel using an 
      <a href="#ethernet">Ethernet</a> (8-wire, straight-through) cable. </p>

      <p>You can connect a modem to almost any Cisco device. (Your modem configuration 
      may be affected by the signals available on the Cisco device, i.e. flow control 
      and hardware handshaking.) Attach the <a href="#rj45schem">CMMOD</a> adapter to the
      female DB-25 connector on most modems, and use an appropriate length of Ethernet 
      cable (and another adapter on the host-side, as needed), as indicated in the 
      illustrations below. </p>

      <p>Whether you attach your modem to the Console, or to the Aux port will need to 
      be reflected in your line configurations. (Do you want to enforce a local login 
      (with a crypt password, stored on the Cisco device), or use a stronger, 
      centralized authentication service (such as RADIUS or TACACS+)? Your line 
      configuration will probably need to include the "line in/out modem" parameter. 
      You also need to configure whether you will need to enable the modem connection 
      for a "protocol" session, such as PPP, which may need an 8-bit clean data path. 
      (In the last case, your modem DCD signal needs to be able to tell the Cisco port 
      when the modem is on-line, so it's more important to get the physical connection 
      right, so that the Cisco port will log the user/session off when the modem 
      connection is lost or dropped.) </p>

      <p>Defining what you need the modem connection to do (and deciding what it 
      shouldn't do, and what it doesn't need to do) should be your first step, then 
      head for the Cisco configuration command reference for your version of IOS. 
      Here are some guidelines for configuring the modems; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine the highest reliable RS-232 speed, common to the Cisco device and 
        the modem...
          <ul>
            <li>Set the modem port speed to that high speed </li>
            <li>Do NOT let the modem "auto-detect" the connection speed, or change 
            the RS-232 port speed! </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set the connection for hardware flow control on the modem and the Cisco port.
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your cables and adapters are wired correctly for flow control. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I normally turn software flow control off... </li>
        <li>Configure the modem so that the DSR and DCD line reflect the 'on-line' status </li>
        <li>Determine the optimum modem config string, and save that to NVRAM on the modem.
          <ul>
            <li>Teach the modem to auto-load that config when the modem resets. </li>
            <li>Teach the modem to reset when the call is disconnected, or DTR is cycled.</li>
            <li>Teach the Cisco how to also send that config string, if needed. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Devices with a Cisco RJ-45(f) console port can be connected using an 
      Ethernet Cable to the <font color="#cc0000"><a href="#rj45schem">CMMOD</a></font> 
      adapter and modem. (You would use a USOC-rolled cable to connect the CMMOD to a
      Cisco-wired patch panel.) </p>

      <p></p>

      <center><img src="ciscomod1.gif" align="bottom" height="39" width="319"> </center>

      <p>Devices with a DB-9(f) console port can be connected using an appropriate 
      DB-9 adapter and an Ethernet Cable. You can refer to my 
      <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/msock.html">Minor Scroll of Console 
      Knowledge</a> for tips on how to make sure you are using the appropriate adapter.</p>

      <p></p>

      <center><img src="ciscomod2.gif" align="bottom" height="39" width="319"> </center>

      <p>Devices with a DB-25(m) console port can be connected using an appropriate 
      DB-25(f) adapter and an Ethernet Cable. (Most Cisco devices which have a DB-25(m) 
      console will also have a DB-25(f) Aux or Modem port, which you can also use.) </p>

      <p></p>

      <center><img src="ciscomod3.gif" align="bottom" height="39" width="319"> </center>

      <p>Finally, realize that the physical connection will be an important starting 
      point. Get the connection set first, including speed settings, before you go 
      much further with your testing. Flow control will likely be your biggest hurdle, 
      since the modem can introduce data latency issues because of speed differences 
      on the telco link, as well as the serial conenctions to the modems on each end of
      the link, as seen in the next illustration.</p>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 205px; height: 50px;" 
      alt="data speeds through a modem connection" src="modem-speeds.jpg"></div>

      <p>If you want to use any compression between the modems, you need to set the 
      serial speed to at least 2x, and preferably 4x (or more) faster than the modem 
      link speed. At 2x, the compression will not give you much advantage, because 
      the modems need time to compress and decompress the data. Using 4x or more will 
      show you some data throughput improvement. But, the higher your serial speed, 
      the more likely you will have flow control issues between the modems. And, if 
      you have a high serial speed trying to send to a slower serial speed, you may 
      find that you are filling buffers in the mode, and possibly at the slower 
      serial link. If flow control isn's set up properly, you will see data loss. </p>

      <p>In summary; using modems in a data link will be a challenge, and maybe even 
      a pain. You will save yourself some grief by spending a bit more, and getting 
      really good modems, from a manufacturer with a good support staff. You should 
      also try to download the manual for the candidate modems from the manufacturers 
      website, and see if you can understand the configuration information about flow
      control, serial and phone speed controls, and compression. If you can't understand 
      the manual, try looking at other manufacturers.</p>

      <p>When you have a device with a non-Cisco RJ-45 console port, you will either 
      need to use a combination of a Cisco adapter (connected to the Cisco device), 
      and another non-Cisco adapter (connected to the non-Cisco device) to create 
      the interface between the two wiring schemes, buy you will need to buy or make 
      a <a href="#cables">special cable</a>. The common choices for these connections 
      are usually DB-25 RS-232 adapters, so you can easily check your work by 
      connecting a <a href="/Tracers/tracers.html">passive RS-232 signal tracer</a>, 
      or a breakout box, in between the adapters. </p>

      <p>Tips for configuring the serial ports on terminal servers for remote access 
      to attached serial devices. (This is the type of configuration that could be 
      used with <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/">Conserver</a>, or to 
      allow someone to use a TCP session to a high-TCP port to the Cisco device, 
      for connecting across the network to a specific serial port on the Cisco device.)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose which line(s) will be used for connecting to serial devices. </li>
        <li>Don't run an 'exec' session on the port(s)
          <ul>
            <li>(if you do, the Cisco login may 'chat' with the attached devices 
            login session...) </li>
            <li>(output data from the attached devices would be perceived as 
            attempts to log in...) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Don't set the port(s) for local login.
          <ul>
            <li>(this will cause the Cisco port to issue a login when it sees the 
            connection. The login will time out, and disconnect the TCP session. 
            Conserver will reinitialize the connection, but this will fill your 
            Conserver logs...) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set the port to allow Reverse Telnet. </li>
        <li>Set the port speed, data bits, parity, and stop-bits (most folks use 9600-8-N-1)
          <ul>
            <li>(there are arguments for setting the port speeds higher.) </li>
            <li>(make sure that the Cisco port speed matches the attached devices 
            port speed.) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Decide if you want/need software or hardware flow control. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can use the example below to get started. </p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre><font color="brown">
line 1 16 (set individual lines, or 'line ranges'...)<br>  no exec
  no login local  (local login will fill your logs...)
  transport input telnet<br>  speed 57600 (pick your speed(s)...)<br>  databits 8
  parity none<br>  stopbits 1<br>  flow control none  (choices are [none|software|hardware])
  </font></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If you are connecting these Console Server ports to the serial consoles of 
      your network equipment, remember to consider these other points; </p>
      <ul>

      port for Reverse-TCP</span></p>

      <p>Normally, the AUX port of a device can be configured with commands similar 
      to those shown above, to respond to reverse-TCP connections. The Aux port has
      typically been assigned as the highest async line in the device, but some AUX 
      ports may not respond to configuration for reverse-TCP. (For example, configure 
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">line aux 0</span> as described above, to be 
      able to enable reverse-TCP to the Aux port.)</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> You can NOT set a Cisco console 
      to respond to reverse-TCP. You can set </span>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">line con 0</span>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> for any of the settings above
      except the transport input telnet, which is the bit that enables
      reverse-TCP.</span></p>

      <p>On a system that uses NM-nnA async modules, presume that
      all of the NM slots will have 32-port modules installed, and total the
      number of ports, and then add one to access the Aux port. (In a C3620,
      you could have two NM-32A modules, for a total of 64 ports, so the Aux
      port would be the 129th port, and you would reverse-TCP to port 2129 to
      reach it, if it has been configurd for transport input telnet. In a
      fully-loaded 3660, the Aux port would be port 2225.)</p>

      <p>On the 2800 and 3800 devices, it seems that the Aux port was
      assigned as line 1 (reverse-TCP to port 2001), and then all of the
      other async ports have line numbers assigned by which slot/port/hwic where
      they are installed. (See the 3800 Config sestion for more info about
      line to slot/port mapping.)</p>

      <p>This doesn't match the Cisco legacy, and Cisco folks are looking to see
      if they can change this in software to match the legacy mentioned here.
      It may be hard-coded in hardware. I don't know when/if it will match
      the legacy model in the future. For now, I can only tell you to test
      one of the lines you have installed, and see which cable responds for you.</p>

      <p>When using the 2600 and 3600 family devices for remote access to attached 
      serial consoles, there are a few things you need to consider. Foremost (in my 
      opinion) is that the "line numbers" (also async interface numbers) are hard-coded 
      to the slots of the chassis. This means that wherever you put your async 
      interface module will determine which line numbers will correspond to those 
      async serial ports. </p>
      <ul>
        Here's the way the async line numbers are assigned;<br>
        <i>Slot 0: lines 1-32<br>
        Slot 1: lines 33-64<br>
        Slot 2: lines 65-96<br>
        Slot 3: lines 97-128<br>
        Slot 4: lines 129-160<br>
        Slot 5: lines 161-192<br>
        Slot 6: lines 193-224</i>
      </ul>

      <p>So, my recommendation is to put the network interface module(s) in the 
      highest-numbered slot(s) when you can, and start loading your NM-xxA cards 
      starting in Slot 0, working your way up consecutively. </p>

      <p>The slot numbers are stamped in the sheet metal that makes up the rear of 
      the chassis, but sometimes the stamping was a bit hard to see. The diagrams 
      showing the slot numbers of the C3620 and C3640 are shown below (looking at 
      the rear of the chassis). </p>

      </p>

      <p>The next issue to consider: the line numbers are assigned in blocks of 32, 
      but you can also use the <b>NM-16A</b> (with only 16 async ports) in any of the 
      slots. However, the port numbers will then have gaps in them. (The line numbers 
      won't shift, due to the smaller number of ports on an NM-16A, to give you a 
      contiguous range.) This is something to be aware of as you are determining which
      TCP port to call for remote access. </p>
      <ul>
        Here's the way the async line would be assigned for NM-16A modules;<br>
        <i>Slot 0: lines 1-16<br>
        Slot 1: lines 33-48<br>
        Slot 2: lines 65-80<br>
        Slot 3: lines 97-112<br>
        Slot 4: lines 129-146<br>
        Slot 5: lines 161-176<br>
        Slot 6: lines 193-208</i>
      </ul>

      <p>Finally, a pet peeve of mine: The designers of the c26xx product family, and 
      the C3660 product, assigned the built-in network interfaces as "Slot 0". From 
      a human-user interface standpoint, I think this was a bad move for two reasons;</p>
      <ul>
        <p>1.) Since the 3620 and 3640 start the slot numbers on the <b>lower-right</b>
        (as you look at the slots on the back panel), then the lower-left, and then 
        the next row up (first the right, then the left), until you run out of slots. 
        In the case of the C3660, with six slots, I'd presume that these were slots 
        0-5, and Slot 6 was the built-in (since it's located at the top).
      </ul>
    </p>
    
      <p>

            Slot 2: lines 65-96<br>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      </p>

      <p>What this design decision means is that, in the largest 3600 chassis
      (the 3660), which you would buy as a 192-port terminal server, that you can 
      never assign lines 1-32. This only becomes a functional issue when humans 
      need to map the 'first' serial port to TCP port 2033, instead of 2001. 
      (Anyone interfacing with these 192 ports needs to keep this 32-port shift in 
      mind, on every interaction.) Fortunately, if you are using 
      <a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver</a> to manage these ports, you 
      only need to worry about this shift once, as you are adding these devices 
      into the configuration file.
      <ul>
        2.) In the case of the c2600 family, I'd have put the NM slot on the right 
        (as you are looking at the rear of the unit), in the 'slot 0' position, and 
        put the built-in interfaces on the left.

      <p>When using the 1800, 2800, and 3800 family devices for remote
      access to attached serial consoles, there are a few things you need to
      consider. Foremost (in my opinion) is that the "line numbers" (also
      async interface numbers) are hard-coded to the HWIC slots of the chassis.
      This means that whichever HWIC port you use for your HWIC async
      interface module will determine which line numbers will correspond to 
      those async serial ports.</p>

      <p>Async&nbsp;line number 1 is reserved for the 
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">AUX</span> port, and the line numbers for 
      the HWIC ports are shifted up accordingly. This is not consistant with Cisco 
      legacy, where the AUX port is the highest line in the chassis. I found this 
      curiosity in July of 2006. After I reported this, Cisco was looking for a way 
      to make the 3800 conform to the legacy sequence. (Testing in September with 
      the 2800 series found that they also have this anomaly, and there is no word 
      from Cisco whether this was a hardware mapping, or if they will change the 
      behavior in a future version of IOS to match the legacy style.) </p>
      <ul>

      Here's the way the async line numbers are assigned;<i><br>
      * Even if you only use HWIC-8A modules, there is still the modulo-16
      offset!<br></i>

      <p>TCP port 2000 should be the chassis itself, and TCP 2001 will be the AUX 
      port, if you have configured it for reverse-TCP.</p>

      <p>So, my recommendation is to put non-async module(s) in the highest-numbered 
      slot(s) when you can, and start loading your HWIC-xxA cards starting in 
      Slot 0/0, working your way up consecutively. In my experience, it's more 
      intuitive to have the async modules in a sequential order. That said, I also 
      recommend loading HWIC-16A cards instead of HWIC-8A cards if you're going to 
      load more than one card, so you have sequential line numbers. (For one thing,
      sequential numbers make it easier to script configuration settings.)</p>

      <p>When using the 1900, 2900 ISR family devices for remote access to attached 
      serial consoles, there are a few things you need to consider. As with the 
      2800 and 3800 devices the "line numbers" (also async interface numbers) are 
      hard-coded to the HWIC slots of the chassis. This means that whichever HWIC 
      port you use for your HWIC async interface module will determine which line 
      numbers will correspond to those async serial ports. BUT, they are not quite
      the same port numbers as with the 2800 and 3800 families!</p>

      <p>Async line number 1 is reserved for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">AUX</span>
      port, and Async line number 2 is reserved for a built-in 
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODEM</span>. Then the line numbers for 
      the HWIC ports are shited up accordingly.</p>
      <ul>

      Here's the way the async line numbers are assigned;<i><br>
      * Even if you only use HWIC-8A modules, there is still the modulo-16
      offset!<br></i>
      </ul>

      <p>TCP port 2000 should be the chassis itself, and TCP 2001 will be the AUX 
      port, if you have configured it for reverse-TCP.</p>

      <p>So, my recommendation is to put non-async module(s) in the highest-numbered 
      slot(s) when you can, and start loading your HWIC-xxA cards starting in 
      Slot 0/0, working your way up consecutively. In my experience, it's more 
      intuitive to have the async modules in a sequential order. That said, I also 
      recommend loading HWIC-16A cards instead of HWIC-8A cards if you're going to 
      load more than one card, so you have sequential line numbers. (For one thing,
      sequential numbers make it easier to script configuration settings.)</p>

      <p>The Cisco 2509-11 Terminal Servers included async ports,
delivered using 68-pin (SCSI-II) connectors to deliver 8 Async Line
interfaces on each connector. (The C2511-RJ model had 16 RJ-45 jacks on
the back panel, instead of the two 68-pin connectors.) </p>

      <p>The <a href="#c3600">Cisco 2600 and 3600
series</a> Access Devices can use an Async Interface module
(NM-16A, or NM-32A) which also uses the 68-pin connectors.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#c2800">Cisco 1800, 2800, and
2800</a> series Access Devices use an HWIC Async Interface
module, and these use a different connector to deliver 8 Async Line
interfaces. These patch panels described below will <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> work with the
HWIC async modules!</p>

      <p>If your equipment is close to your Terminal/Console
Server devices, you could use the "Hydra" cable (Cisco part <b>72-0845-01</b>),
but those cables are only 3 feet long. If you want to connect to
devices farther away, you can connect these with Cisco-schema patch
panel options from <a href="http://www.apacn.com">APA
Cables &amp; Networks</a>. </p>

      <p><b>Option #1</b> is a single rack-unit-high
patch panel, with 16 ports, and two (2) 1-meter-long cables, with the
68-pin connectors. Be aware that these are slightly larger than 1-Rack
Unit tall, which will affect rack mount spacing. </p>

      <ul>

        <li>1) One 16-port Patch Panel for each 2509-11 device
(APACN part number <b><font color="#cc0000">19309-01</font></b>).
You can use two of these patch panels for each NM-32A module. </li>

      </ul>

      <p><b>Option #2</b> is a combination of a
2-Rack Unit-tall, 48-port patch panel, having six (6) AMP 50-pin
telco-type connectors with 1'-long cables. (Each AMP connector serves 8
RJ-45 connectors on the patch panel). You will also need an appropriate
number of adapter cables with 68-pin (SCSI-II connectors) on one end,
and the 50-pin AMP connectors on the other end. </p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>

          <li>48-port patch panel (APACN part number <b><font color="#cc0000">19309-03</font></b>, $475.00 USD
each) </li>

          <li>8-port 68-pin SCSI-II connector to 50-pin AMP
(telco) connector (APACN part number <b><font color="#cc0000">19309-02</font></b>,
$90 USD each), and <b>you need one of these cable assemblies for
every 8-port async connector</b>. </li>

        </ol>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The port density with Option #2 is much better for
high-density applications, where you want a lot of ports close to each
other. I've seen these deployed in instances where the (usually) C3640
or c3660 are deployed, and the patch panels are mounted close to the
C3600, and then Ethernet cables are used to connect the patch panel
connectors to "infrastructure cabling" patch panels, in order to
connect to devices in other racks in the data center. (A second option
is to put the patch panel in the rack near all of the devices where you
need console connections, and use longer Telco-type extension cables to
connect the patch panels to the Cisco 3600 device in another rack.
However, there are few instances that I've seen where you need 48
console ports in a single rack.) </p>

      <p><b>Useful Extras:</b> The threaded nuts that
retain the serial cable harnesses on the Cisco 2509-2511 communications
servers, and the async modules for the 3600 series devices, is a wider
diameter than the screws on the APACN cable harnesses themselves (so
the screws on the harness cables cannot be tightened to the 68-pin
connector on the C25xx or NM-xxA). You can get the proper threaded
standoffs from APA Cables &amp; Networks (<a href="http://www.apacn.com">www.apacn.com</a>) by
asking for part number <b><font color="#cc0000">25057</font></b>
("AMP female screw-lock kit", only two pieces/bag), for about $2.50
(USD) per bag(!). You will need one bag per connector, so you will need
two bags per 2509-11, and 4 bags for each NM-32A module. </p>

      <p>You can reach <a href="http://www.apacn.com">APA
Cables &amp; Networks</a> at (voice) 800-422-2537 x-762 or
(fax) 763-475-8457. Steve Vacik ('svacik' at apacn.com) has been
helpful in the past. (I received notice in late DEC 2007 that APACN is
changing thei name. I'll update this contact information once I can
find out that they are still going to support serial console stuff) </p>

      <p> <b>Option #3</b> is a product from Great
Lakes Wire &amp; Cable, (Kevin Reber, 888-833-4592,
sales@greatwire.com). They have a 1 rack-unit panel with <a href="greatlakes-16.pdf">(16) DB25 connectors</a>, and
another&nbsp;1 rack-unit panel with <a href="greatlakes-32.pdf">(32)
RJ45 connectors</a>. They have cables from the patch panels to
either the Cisco NM async interface, or to the HWIC interface. You can
also specify DTE or DCE interfaces (by choosing the appropriate
interface cable) which offeres some interesting flexibility.</p>

            <p>When you are deploying console servers, you may
still want to have a way to wheel a terminal or a laptop up to a
machine to check configurations (basically, the practical (or paranoid)
among us want to have a safety net, in case the console services fail).
In this case, using <a href="#rj45schem">modular adapters</a>
actually simplifies our job! </p>

            <p>By connecting all of your remote consoles to the
patch panels using Ethernet cables, all you need to do is connect an
adapter to your laptop, and set up a Terminal Emulator package to talk
to the serial port of the laptop. </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><font color="#af0000">If you want
to set up a "crash cart", I'd also suggest that you set the serial port
speed on all of your consoles to 9600 bps, 8-N-1 (since is the most
common setting). Having a common speed removes one more variable to
have to remember during a crisis.</font> </p>

              <p><font color="#af0000">If you have
any </font><b><font color="#af0000">Sun</font></b><font color="#af0000"> workstations connected to your console

some SGI and NeXT hosts.)</font> </p>

            <p>The standard "terminal" adapter that Cisco
provides (APACN equiv. is <b><a href="#rj45schem">CFDTE91</a></b>),
when connected to your laptop, will give you an RJ-45, Cisco-schema

will give you an RJ-45, Cisco-schema connection that is wired like a
Cisco RJ-45 console port. </p>

            <p>When you have successfully configured your
devices, you can then disconnect the Ethernet cable on the device that
you want to connect to, and use an Ethernet cable between the connector
on your PC and the other device. Your physical connection will be in
place, and you only need to ensure that your logical port settings on
the PC match those of the other device. </p>

      <p>I've only had three reports of a Cisco NM-xxA interface
causing a Sun device to halt. In resolving two of the three cases, we
finally absolved the Cisco port, after the sites used a properly-wired
serial adapter. (The first site didn't involve me until they had
abandoned the Cisco solution, so they couldn't be sure, or show me the
parts they had used.) I'm still hopeful that I may one day get the
schematic of an adapter that causes such a scenario. </p>

      <p>I am a strong proponent of buying pre-wired, pre-labeled
adapters and cables. Generally speaking, you probably can't build an
adapter cheaper, if you consider the value of your time as well as the
component costs. And, whether or not I can make 100 adapters without a
mistake isn't being questioned, I'm sure I'd rather not make 100 by
myself. The best advantages for buying pre-built adapters and pre-wired
cables include; </p>

      <ul>

        <li>Consistent wiring and labeling of the parts. </li>

        <li>Consistent shell colors and labels aides in
troubleshooting, by visually identifying the parts. </li>

        <li>Enhances reliability, knowing you can grab any
adapter and count on it being wired correctly. </li>

        <li>If you need a LOT of adapters or cables for a
build-out, you probably don't want to build them all yourself! </li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can purchase any of the adapters and cables listed
on these pages individually (or in bulk) from APA Cables &amp;
Networks (<a href="http://www.apacn.com/">www.apacn.com</a>).
You also have the option of buying a <a href="ciscokit.html">Cisco
Console Kit</a>, which includes a complete set of adapters, and
some of the specialty <a href="#cables">cables</a>
listed above, as well as a passive RS-232 Signal Tracer. The default
shell color is black for Cisco adapters. You can get the shells in
another color if you want, provided you want one of the colors listed
below: </p>

      <p>Available colors: <b>BK</b> = black, <b>GN</b>
= green, <b>RD</b> = red, <b>YL</b> = yellow,
      <b>BL</b> = blue, <b>GY</b> = grey </p>

      <p>So, the APACN part number <b>CFDTE91-GN</b>
would denote the DB-9 female DTE adapter, wired for the Cisco RJ-45
format, but supplied with a green plastic shell (instead of the default
black shell). </p>

      <p>APA Cables &amp; Networks also sells adapters and
adapter kits for other RJ-45 schema, including the <a href="../Annex/annexkit.html">Annex/Bay/Nortel</a>, <a href="../IOLAN/iolankit.html">IOLAN Rack+</a> and <a href="../Xyplex/xyplexkit.html">Xyplex</a> terminal
server families. APA Cables &amp; Networks uses different default
colors to make it easier to visually identify the different RJ-45
wiring schema. </p>

      <p>The DB-25 adapters are wired according to the older
Cisco equivalents (from the CS-500 days). The DB-9 parts are derivative
works. The signaling for the Cisco RJ-45 consoles is shown <a href="#rj45">at the beginning of this guide</a>. </p>

      <p>With all of this said, I also understand that sometimes
you just need to make that one cable or adapter, and buying just one
isn't practical. So, here are the schematics. (The APA Cables &amp;
Networks part number is shown below each adapter. If there is a Cisco
equivalent, I've noted the Cisco part number as well.) </p>

      <p>As with adapters, I recommend buying pre-built, pre-labeled, tested cables. 
      APA Cables and Networks sells specialty cables for connecting Cisco consoles 
      and patch panel ports to other console servers and devices, and these can be 
      ordered from the descriptions and part numbers shown below. The default length 
      is 7 feet, but you can order custom lengths as needed. The cables come with
      black boots on the RJ-45 end, and labels denoting the Cisco end. The MMJ end 
      does not get a boot, since they can't find anyone who makes a colored MMJ boot.</p>

      <p>Most Sun hardware has used a female DB-25 connector for the TTY A and B 
      ports. (Use a <a href="#rj45schem">CMDCE</a> adapter to connect to a Cisco 
      console port, or a <a href="#rj45schem">CMDTE</a> adapter to connect them to
      a Cisco-wired patch panel.) </p>

      <p>The Sun Netra T-1 (model 105) uses an RJ-45 console, and it happens to be 
      wired identically to the Cisco console port. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To connect a Netra T-1 105 to a Cisco console port, use a 
        <a href="#ethernet">rolled cable</a>. </li>
        <li>To connect a Netra T-1 105 to a Cisco patch panel, use an 
        <a href="#ethernet">Ethernet cable</a>. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The DB-25 serial adapter that comes with the Sun Netra T-1 (<b>Sun p/n 
      530-2889-02</b>) is wired similarly to the APACN CMDCE adapter, with the 
      addition of adding a 'frame ground'. The plastic DB-25 shell has a metalized 
      coating, and a drain ground lead is attached from pin 1 of the DB-25(m) 
      connector to a lead attached to the metalized shell. The schematic on the 
      <b>Sun p/n 530-2889-03</b> is similar, except they changed the colors of 
      the wires inside the shell (and the tabs which hold the DB-25 connector 
      are <i>much</i> more fragile, so take my word on the wiring inside!) </p>

      <p>The Sun Netra T-3 disk arrays use an <b>RJ-13</b> connector for it's 
      RS-232 console, and you only get data and ground for your connection (no 
      flow control or handshaking). APA Cables and Networks sells a couple of 
      cables for connecting these devices (black boot on the Cisco end, no boot 
      on the RJ-13 end); </p>

      <p>Cisco provides one female DB-9 to RJ-45 adapter (Cisco Part Number: 
      <b>74-0495-01</b>, labeled "terminal"), which is most often used to connect 
      PC serial (COM) port to the RJ-45 console of a Cisco device, using the CAB-500 
      (Cisco, rolled) cable. This adapter can also allow you to connect to other 
      DB-9 or DB-25 console ports on devices made by Cisco and other vendors. 
      The <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA Cables and Networks</a> equivalent 
      part number is <font color="#cc0000">24490-07</font> (also called "
      <a href="#rj45schem">CFDTE91</a>"). This adapter does not include wiring for 
      the DCD signal on the DB-9 connector (pin 1), which many PC-platforms expect 
      for their "console redirection" functions. </p>

      <p>There are three other compatible DB-9 to Cisco-schema RJ-45 adapters available 
      from <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA Cables and Networks</a> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>female adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#cc0000">24490-14</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CFDCE91</a>"). </li>
        <li>male adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#cc0000">24490-23</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMDTE91</a>"). </li>
        <li>male adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#af0000">24490-24</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMDCE91</a>"). </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Rather than list all of the connection possibilities on this page, I have 
      created my <a href="cisco-hosts.html">Cisco Host-to-Adapters Page</a>, which 
      lists which adapter (or cable) you will need to connect any device on the 
      list to a Cisco console or aux port, or to a Cisco-schema patch panel port. </p>

      <p>There are currently four additional DB-9 to Cisco-schema RJ-45 adapters 
      <b>with DSR tied to DCD</b> available from 
      <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a>; </p>

      <ul>
        <li>female adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#cc0000">24490-59</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CFDTE92</a>"). </li>
        <li>female adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#cc0000">24490-60</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CFDCE92</a>"). </li>
        <li>male adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#cc0000">24490-67</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMDTE92</a>"). </li>
        <li>male adapter, APACN part number: <font color="#af0000">24490-66</font> 
        ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMDCE92</a>"). </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: Some Catalyst 1900-series switches use a DB-9 console
connection, instead of the RJ-45 connector. Some of these devices do
not like a connection between DB-9 pin 1 and pin 6, connecting DSR to
DCD on the DB-9, while other versions of the 1900 will <b>require</b>
this connection. (If the Cisco 1900 you have attached a DB-9 adapter to
is spewing AT modem commands out the port, you've got the wrong
adapter...add or remove the loop as needed.) The <b>CFD*E91</b>
does not have the DCD connection tied to DSR, while the <b>CFD*E92</b>
series does have the tie connecting DSR to DCD on the DB-9. </p>

      <p>There was a previous <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a>
part number: <font color="#cc0000">24245-DTE-BK</font>,
which was wired to tie DB-9 pins 1 and 6 together. However, the wire
was connected directly to pin 1, and then looped to pin 6. (If you
decided that you didn't need the DCD signal, and cut the loop, you
would still have DCD, but would have lost DSR...things may not behave
the way you might expect.) </p>

      <p><a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a> sells any of these adapters 
      (individual or bulk), as well as a <a href="ciscokit.html">complete 
      adapter/cable set</a>. </p>

      <p>Cisco provides either one or two DB-25 to RJ-45 adapters
with new equipment; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>one female adapter (Cisco Part Number: <b>29-0810-01</b>,
commonly labeled "Terminal" or "CAB-500DTF"), which is most often used
to connect to male DB-25 AUX ports on many Cisco devices.<br>
(<a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a> part
number: <font color="#af0000">24490-02</font> ("<a href="#rj45schem">CFDTE</a>"), previous part number:
24245"-DTE-BK) </li>
        <li>one male adapter (Cisco Part Number: <b>29-0881-01</b>,
commonly labeled "MODEM" or CAB-500DCM"),<br>
(<a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a> part
number: <font color="#af0000">24490-05</font> ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMMOD</a>"), 
previous part number: 24238-DTE-BK;<br>
MOD-TAP part number 06-888-E76-20.) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are three other DB-25 to RJ-45 adapters that Cisco
used to provide; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>female adapter (old Cisco Part Number: <b>29-0809-01</b>),
          connect to male DB-25 AUX ports on many Cisco devices.<br>
          (<a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a> part number
          <font color="#af0000">24490-01</font> 
          ("<a href="#rj45schem">CFDCE</a>"). </li>
        <li>male adapter (old Cisco Part Number: <b>29-0811-01</b>),<br>
          <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a>
          part number: <font color="#af0000">24490-04</font>
          ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMDTE</a>"). </li>
        <li>male adapter (old Cisco Part Number: <b>29-0808-01</b>),<br>
          <a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APACN</a>
           part number: <font color="#af0000">24490-03</font>
          ("<a href="#rj45schem">CMDCE</a>");<br>
          MOD-TAP part number 06-888-E76-20. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Rather than list all of the possibilities here, I have
created an <a href="cisco-hosts.html">Cisco
Host-to-Adapters Page</a>, which lists the various combinations
of male and female, DTE/DCE, DB-9 and DB-25, with a list of the various
devices which fall under each connector type. The list also tells you
which adapter (or cable) you will need to connect each device to either
a Cisco console port, or to a <a href="#patch">Patch Panel</a>.
      </p>

      <p><a href="http://www.apacn.com/">APA Cables
and Networks</a> sells any of these adapters (individual or
bulk), as well as a <a href="ciscokit.html">complete
adapter/cable set</a>. </p>

      <p>Some Cisco devices devices (mainly the ISR families) have been sporting a
      USB console port, as well as the traditional, "legacy" RJ45 RS-232 console.</p>

      <p>I posted a couple blog posts about these USB consoles, and the most relevant
      is likely this one, 
      <a href="http://consoleteam.blogspot.com/2014/01/more-about-ciscos-usb-console-port.html">this
      one</a>, but there are a few details that I'll list here as well.</p>

      <p><ul>
      <li>The USB chip on the cable gets power from the Cisco chassis, but the chip 
      is initialized by driver software to complete the initialization.</li>
      <li> When the chip is initialized, and LED near the USB connector illuminates, 
      indicating that the RJ-45 console is now diverted to USB.</li>
      <li>The original driver software (for windows systems) is from 2010.</li>
      <li>You need to get the drivers from the Cisco website.</li>
      <li>The drivers only support Windows XP, Vista, server 2000.</li>
      <li> Not all versions of IOS support the command<pre>usb-inactivity-timeout 30</pre></li>
      </ul></p>
