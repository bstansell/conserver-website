         <P><B>Project Summary</B></P>
         
         <P>The concept is to provide a mobile demo platform that can
         be driven to venues, to show off Web-TV products. The
         satellite link is suggested to free us from the problem of
         scheduling appearances far enough in advance as to allow the
         temporary installation (and testing, etc.) of high-capacity
         network links to connect the demo units with the Web-TV
         Service Network.</P>
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>(This paper is put together from
         conversations and thoughts based on those conversations. It
         should not be interpreted as a project plan, although the
         contents may be used as a straw man for future
         discussions.)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

         <P>In the case that the truck is ordered, and the equipment
         is deployed, I can see a need for the capability to remotely
         configure the equipment in the truck. In the 'normal'
         configuration, the satellite link would be the primary
         network path, and with the judicious use of some network
         gear, we can add a great deal of remote configuration
         support to the trailer.</P>
         
         <P><B>Presumptions:</B></P>
         
         <OL>
            <LI>Transport staff may only have junior-level
            system/network skills.
            
            <LI>The trailer will have GPS and electronic compass (for
            satellite pointing).
            
            <LI>Demo staff would travel to meet the trailer
            separately.
            
            <LI>Technical staff would be on-call to help support the
            trailer activities.
            
            <LI>Being related to the ISP service, SOC/NSG could
            possibly monitor the trailer gear.

         <P>The truck will appear in different time zones, from time
         to time. Do we want to consider using a ZIP code from a
         low-population-density area from each of the time zones, so
         that the hour-to-hour programming maps correctly?</P>
         
         <P>Using a small, RV-style TV antenna, it's possible that we
         could pick up one or more 'local' off-air channels wherever
         the trailer is, and use Channel Processors to put them onto
         specific channels.</P>
         
         <P>Some canned content could come from DVD players on-board
         the trailer.</P>
         
         <P>Once the satellites are acquired, we might be able to
         derive channels and turn them into analog channels on the
         trailer, to highlight partner networks (MSNBC, etc.)

         <P><IMG SRC="satdemo1.gif" WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=653
         X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=left>The
         Network portion is provided by the WNI network connections
         at Silicon Valley Campus, where a 10 Mbps connection is made
         to the "Network" router  (router 2 in this diagram).</P>
         
         <P>The EIA-530 serial cable link connects the router to the
         "Network" satellite modem, an SPL/ACT SkyLane SL-512 modem.
         The output of the modem is a 70 MHz IF stream. The input is
         adjustable, in the 950-1200 MHz ("L-Band") range.</P>
         
         <P>On the test bench, the 70 MHz IF goes into a Cross
         Technologies model 2005 Test Upconverter, which allows us to
         set the frequency for the carrier that will be sent to the
         receiver on the "Trailer" modem.</P>
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>These Test Upconverters limit our test
         link bandwidth to 64 Kbps, which is marginally more than a
         56 Kbps modem call, with no delay on the link. In actual
         use, the modem would be fed into a high-speed uplink,
         providing 500 Mbps bandwidth for the link, with 1/2-3/4
         second link latency.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
         
         <P>The "Trailer" end of the link has a matching modem,
         connected to another router. On the test bench, this is
         connected directly to the Ascend NAS via a CAT-5 crossover
         ethernet cable.</P>
         
         <P>The connection between the Ascend NAS and the Gordon
         Kapes System 930 Telephony Simulator is a standard CAT-5
         ethernet cable, but the signaling is actually an ISDN PRI
         (1.5 Mbps) link. The G.K. box is basically a very small
         Central Office in this configuration.</P>
         
         <P>We will attach up to four set-top boxes directly to the
         G.K., using RJ-11 phone cables. The device can support 48
         lines, but the additional lines would need to come from
         24-port patch panels (connected via 50-pin AMP/Cinch
         connectors).

         <P><IMG SRC="satdemo2.gif" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=524
         X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=left>Much of
         the network equipment in the network diagram (shown at left)
         has asynchronous serial console ports to aid in
         configuration. (In the case of network gear, the serial port
         might be the only way to configure the equipment if the
         network interface is misconfigured.)</P>
         
         <P>One suggestion is to use a router with multiple async
         serial ports, which are capable of supporting Reverse Telnet
         access. (A Cisco 2511 provides 16 async ports, in addition
         to the high-speed serial link for the satellite modem.) You
         could also consider a stand-alone terminal server, instead
         of a router-and-terminal server combination.</P>
         
         <P>There should be a PC on-board, configured to perform
         diagnostics on the network and equipment. This device should
         have a scriptable application environment, so that custom
         scripting can be built to perform high- and low-level
         diagnostics of the equipment. This could include a built-in
         modem, that could test-dial in through the telephony
         simulator, and test connections to the Ascend NAS.</P>
         
         <P>If the link back to the network fails, there are a number
         of tests that could be performed. Do you want a human to do
         that testing, or do you want a computer to do the testing,
         and report the results (maybe even suggesting possible
         resolutions to the problems)?</P>
         
         <P>The serial data output from the GPS receiver can be
         <B>split</B>, so that it goes to both the device controlling
         the pointing of the satellite dish(es), as well as to a
         terminal server port. This way, once the link is up, the
         network operations center can get access to the Lat./Long.
         data, if that information would be useful for plotting the
         location of the trailer in a mapping application. (It's
         conceivable that the same GPS could be used for
         computer-aided navigation for the truck driver.)</P>
         
         <P>If any of the set-top boxes have diagnostic ports on
         them, it's possible that they can be connected to the
         terminal server, allowing on-site developers to use the
         diagnostics machine to monitor the output. (Developers back
         at SVC might also be able to watch the output of those
         ports.)</P>
         
         <P>The diagnostics PC could also be the documentation
         repository (HTML pages for text and images), using Front
         Page to remotely update the documentation as needed, or
         simply bringing a floppy and/or CD media for physically
         updating the machine.</P>
         
         <P>What about adding a web-cam capability, so we can see the
         lights on the equipment?

               <LI>An alternative would be to browse the web for

               while the satellite antennas were up, during
               transponder windows. This would require a bunch of
