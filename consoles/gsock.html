<p>This document provides links to various pages with information
regarding serial ports, console servers, and the
<b><a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver application</a></b>. My
hope is that these pages will be useful information to people trying to
connect various devices and hosts to console servers.</p>

<p>If you are managing devices, and those devices have serial ports,
you can probably benefit from providing a way to talk to those serial
ports remotely. In some cases, the serial console to a device can be
your last chance to access the device without a reboot, allowing you
to restore other services without interrupting active services, or
impacting your customers (however you define 'customers'). The cost
for remote access equipment (i.e. console servers) can be high, but
adding an open-source logging and access server (like Conserver) 
can greatly increase the value of the remote access equipment, by 
adding the ability to control accounts and access across multiple 
console servers, providing the ability for multiple users to 
simultaneously access any single port (great for mentoring), and 
logging (very useful for forensics), and more.</p>

<p>My current projects include working with Service Processors 
(*LOM, *RAC interfaces), principally involving the "how do you set 
these up?" problems, whether that is through the BIOS, via the system
serial port, or via some scripts/applications in Windows or Linux.</p>

<p>If you find any errors on these pages, have comments for me,
or if you have additional information that you feel that I 
could include, please send email to <b>consoles</b> at 
<b>conserver.com</b>. Are you curious 
<a href="about.html">why do I keep up these pages?</a> I've also 
started a <a href="http://consoleteam.blogspot.com/">ConsoleTeam
blog</a>, as a place to put ideas for which I'm not ready to
create a dedicated page (or to post ideas early, until I have time to
post a more complete page).</p>

<h3><a name="BREAK"></a>Console Servers and Serial BREAK</h3>

<p>If you are trying to administer Sun servers (and some SGI
boxes), you understand the importance of being able to send Serial
BREAK to the serial console when <b>you</b> want to. Unfortunately,
many older terminal server devices will send BREAK when the power is
removed from the terminal server, which would stop older attached Sun
devices at once. The good news is, we've been
<a href="BREAK-off/breaktest.html">testing</a> many vendors hardware,
and many newer Console Server devices (a very important distinction
these days) are "Sun-safe", including the Cisco 3600 series (anything
using the NM-16A/32A modules), &nbsp;Cisco 3800 series (anything
using the HWIC interfaces), Cyclades TS and ACS lines, Digi's CM
series, the Opengear CM series. the Perle
CS9000, the iTouch (MRV) Communications In-Reach series, the
Computone (AlturaXL) RAS2000 line, and even the new DECservers! You
can find out more information on our
<a href="BREAK-off/breakinfo.html">BREAK-off test result page</a>.
There are also pages about <a href="BREAK-off/breakoff.html">why
we do this</a> testing, and thanks for the
<a href="BREAK-off/breakacks.html">folks that have helped</a>.</p>

<p><font color="brown"><i>The bottom lines with our investigation: 
<ul>
  <li>Using multi-voltage power supplies in the device causes BREAK</li>
  <li>Moving to a single-voltage power supply in the unit seemed to fix it!</li>
  <li>If a device is labeled as a "Terminal Server" you should beware, and test first!</li>
  <li>If a device is labeled as a "Console Server", it may be BREAK-safe (still, test it!)</li>
</ul>
</i></font></p>

<h3><a name="guides"></a>Console Connection
Guides</h3>

<p>The guides shown below are the result of a lot of evolution, and
shared knowledge. They were developed when I needed to do a lot of
work with a particular brand, or when I've had the chance to learn
enough about a device and I want to share that info with others. Much
of what you will find on these pages is common across most of the
devices, but there is also some vendor- and model-specific
information as well. I will likely add a few more guides in the
future, mainly driven by servers that do <b>not</b> send
<a href="BREAK-off/breakoff.html">serial BREAK</a>
at inappropriate times.</p>

<p><b>Host-to-Adapter Guides</b> are generated from a PERL script,
from a database of information about the serial ports on more than
500 devices. The pages list basic information about the host, as well
as advising which adapter or cable to use to connect to specific
console servers. (These refer to the 'best' single adapter to use,
even if it is NOT an adapter that the Console Server manufacturer
provides.)</p>

<p><b>Adapter Kits</b> are listed when the cables and
adapters are readily available from a vendor. Currently, APA Cables
&amp; Networks provide an easy way to get large quantities
of reliable, labeled cables and adapters for the product families
below. If you need smaller amounts, you can check
my <a href="wheretobuy.html">Where To Buy</a> page
for more clues.
</p>

<p>(I have found that most Console Server
device manufacturers offer a small group of adapters to cover the
'common' connections, but they do NOT offer a complete assortment of
adapters and cables for the specialty cases. I am a strong proponent
of using pre-wired (tested and labeled) adapters and cables. More
than likely, the value of the amount of your time to make amore than
a few adapters (plus the cost of the raw materials) is likely to be
more than the cost of pre-wired adapters.)</p>

<p><b>PalmDoc References</b> are available for some of the pages
below. (If you see the download arrow icon, you can click on it to
get the PDB file.) I developed these for use with my old Palm Vx, so
I would have the information in my pocket anytime. I prefer the
TealDoc reader from TealPoint software, but you should be able to
read them with any reader that supports the PalmDoc format.</p>

<p>The Adapter Kits were developed with Americable (which became
APACN, which is becoming Clearfield Communications), but they don't
have kits for Cyclades, Digi, or Opengear and others. As a result, I'm
developing a "<a href="wheretobuy.html">Where to buy
adapters</a>" page, and I've been posting the schematics for
various adapters ad cables on the pages the various Console Connection
Guides. (There will be guides coming for Cyclades, Digi, and Opengear.)
At some point, I'll remove the specific links to the adapter kits from
this page.</p>

<h3><a name="minor"></a>Minor Scrolls...</h3>

<p>My old <b>Minor Scroll of Console
Knowledge</b> had become too big, so I broke it up into smaller
topics. More pages will be added, based on my time, and peoples
interest.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I also have started to make some minor pages, for some Console
Servers and other devices, hoping to share some clues about 
them, until I take the time to make them into full-blown Guide 
pages. The first one up was my 
<a href="DEC/index.html">DECServer page</a>. I'm working on a 
full-blown Console Connection Guide for the Cyclades (now Avocent) 
TS and ACS series console servers. Other pages for the 
Opengear CM series and the Digi CM series are also currently 
in the works. This includes making the cable and adapter schematic 
art, and  integrating them with the host information database.</p>

<p>As of 12 July 2008, the host information database knows about 
   763 different devices.</p>


<h3><a name="training"></a>Training</h3>

<p>Alas, <a href="http://www.sysadminmag.com/">SysAdmin Magazine</a>
has ceased publication. Thankfully, the articles are still available
online for your information, and your browsing pleasure. I will not
be teaching at 
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa08/">USENIX LISA 2008</a>, 
but I hope to see some of you there as a participant.</p>

<p>I have prepared various articles and presentations, over the
years, for contract training and formal conferences. I've made 
some of this information available on the web. As I can
release more information to the web, I'll post the links on my
<a href="Training/published.html">Published Info</a>

<h3><a name="conserver"></a>The Conserver application</h3>

<p>Bryan Stansell (<a href="http://www.tellme.com/">TellMe</a>,
now Microsoft) is the current keeper of the
<a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver application</a>,
which
adds logging, and multi-user access for remote administration of
serial ports, using locally-installed multi-port serial interfaces,
and/or "reverse-telnet" to console servers. This adds a mentoring,
and forensics data collection capability to remote administration of
network and host devices via their serial console ports. Conserver
is free, and an open-source project with an international user base,
and an active user community, a well as being actively developed.
