<h2><center>Zonker's Infrequent Website Updates</center></h2>

<h4><center>http://www.conserver.com/consoles/news.html<br>
(updated:Aug 03, 2008, 09:44 pm)</center></h4>

<p>Until I make the time to figure out how to make this an RSS feed,
so interested folks can subscribe to it. I've decided to put the news
in a separate file.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Summer, 2008:</span> The host-to-adapter 
database topped 700 devices early in the new year. This was the milestone I needed to push me 
into finishing the new line art (mainly adapter schematics) for my console pages. I've already
put the new <a href="Cyclades/cycladescons.html">Cyclades Console Connection Guide</a> up
on the Conserver site. I'm still updating the scripts to create the host-to-adapter pages
for Cyclades, Digi, and Opengear. Since I won't be teaching at USENIX LISA 2008, I'm planning
to be there as a student, and I'm looking forward to seeing some of you at the Consever BoF!</p>

<p>While updating pages, and checking links, I found that the <b>Digital (DEC) Network Products
Group (<a href="http://www.dnpg.com/">www.dnpg.com</a> now points to what appears to be a 
vendor for <i>legacy</i> network gear. You can still get some Cabletron gear from the same 
place, but can you get support? All of the 'deep links' to the DNPG support documentation
has been lost. I hope it's been saved somewhere.</p>

<ul>
  <p><i>Note to self: Make copies of online resources while I can, back-up to physical
  media, such as CD, for the day that the online versions go away!<br><br>
  Note to self #2: Send a Thank You email to the Nortel folks, for continuing to host
  and post their store of information for the old Xylogics microAnnex line (which became
  Bay Networks Annex, which became Nortel, and which Nortel retired). Thanks for helping
  keep the old stuff out of a landfill!</i></p>
</ul>

<p>My new project work has me hip-deep in old <b>Lantronix ETS32PR</b> terminal servers.
Yes, the have the BREAK problem. I'm also surrounded by <b>Service Processors</b> from
Dell, Sun, HP and others. The more I work with these devices, the more I think that the
<a href="http://www.realweasel.com/">RealWeasel</a> folks had the right idea with their
<a href="http://www.realweasel.com/intro.html">PC Weasel</a> products. That's the best
implementation so far, in my opinion, since you can put it into any server. The 
Rackable Systems
<a href="http://www.rackable.com/products/remotemgmt.aspx?nid=datacenter_4">Roamer</a>
implementation is a great solutions, if you're buying servers from Rackable, but you
can't get it as an add-in for other servers you may already have. On the positive side, 
the complexity of interactions of these Service Processors brings me many interesting
puzzles, and chances to learn something new.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update, New Year
2008:</span> Wow! I'm surprised that I let this page get so old!
Sorry! I started the
<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://consoleteam.blogspot.com/">ConsoleTeam blog</a>
early in 2007, and I've posted most of the news and current short
topics there. But it looks like I still lost another 18 months
somewhere. Here's what I hadn't posted on the News page...but try to
check the blog occasionally for the latest info.</p>

<p>I've changed employers in the past couple years, and I missed
a chance to teach at 
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">USENIX</span></a>
LISA 2006.</p>

<p>Over the past couple years, I've worked on a few Conserver
deployments, had a LOT of experience with Cyclades (including upgrading
some very old units to current code), so I expect to have a
Cyclades/Avocent page finished early in 2008. I've also had some
chances to work with Digi and Opengear products, and with the <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/Cisco/ciscocons.html#c2800">Cisco
HWIC modules</a>. These were documented on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/BREAK-off/breakinfo.html">BREAK-off
results page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the addition of test gear to the lab, I've also spent
this fall updating the adapter artwork! Most adapter and cable
schematics are now posted on the <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/#guides">Console
Connection Guides</a>. I've also had to expand the artwork, to
account for Cisco to Cyclades, Xyplex to digi and etc. (the matrix
keeps getting bigger).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/#guides">host-to-adapter
guides</a> list now tops 700 devices, thanks to Jeff Komori and
Lou Owayni at Adaptec for letting me get to check the ports on a bunch
of gear there (nearly 40 new devices just from that trip).</p>

<p>Cyclades was acquired by Avocent early in 2006. There seems to have
been some trouble transfering Cyclades info into the KnowledgeBase at
Avocent (I find few articles when searching), but the support folks
have been pretty responsive so far. The old Cyclades website (<a href="http://www.cyclades.com/">www.cyclades.com</a>)
now takes you to Avocent, but the old Cyclades anonymous FTP sites (<a href="ftp://ftp.cyclades.com/">ftp.cyclades.com</a>
and <a href="ftp://ftp.cyclades.de/">ftp.cyclades.de</a>)
are still online, with the legacy software versions, so keep these
links in your bookmarks, and consider getting copies of the software
and release notes files you might need for your older gear soon!
Avocent is still
supporting TS series owners, but there is no new code development. The
ACS line is still being produced, but with different case tooling and
Avocent logo and paint. The <a href="http://www.avocent.com/web/en.nsf/Content/Cyclades_PM">PM
series</a> power managers are sharing the spotlight with
Avocent's <a href="http://www.avocent.com/web/en.nsf/Content/SPC400">SPC</a>,
and <a href="http://servertech.com/">Server Technologies</a>
devices.</p>

<p>I found the <a href="http://www.blueconsole.com/">BlueConsole</a>
bluetooth wireless serial adapters, but after two years, the
manufacturer is closing the doors in JAN 2008. They are handy, but
pricey. I found them to be sturdy, well constructed, and they've earned
a place in my <a href="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/MyDoctorBag/doctorbag.html">Doctors
Bag</a>. He also lists his <a href="http://www.blueconsole.com/BlueConsole-Compete.pdf">competition</a>,
in case this kind of thing interest you.</p>

<p>I also registered the ConsoleTeam domains, but I haven't made the time
to learn PHP to the point that I'm ready to build a full customer
support site. I've been spending some time getting to know <a href="http://www.crypt.gen.nz/logsurfer/">LogSurfer+</a>
(the heir-apparent to Swatch) for watching my logs for interesting
strings. I also want to dabble with <a href="http://www.splunk.org/">Splunk</a>,
but I've been waiting for a server upgrade (dual multi-core CPUs)
before I add that to the current mix.</p>

<p><b>Update, Spring 2005:</b> The site updating
continues! Many new
pages, including <a href="Training/published.html">available
past tutorials and training</a>, what's in my <a href="MyDoctorBag/doctorbag.html">serial Doctor Bag</a>,
<a href="Clues/modems.html">modem</a> and <a href="Clues/rs232.html">RS-232</a>
clues pages. (Heck, even <b>this page</b> is new!) And
with all of the new
pages, I finally released the new <a href="gsock.html">Greater
Scroll</a> and <a href="msock.html">Minor Scroll</a>
of Console Knowledge.</p>

<p>There is much more work to do, including updates for the
Xyplex, IOLAN,
and Annex pages, and then making a new set of pages for Cyclades, and
maybe
a Digi CM page as time permits. (I'm also entertaining the idea of
preparing
another tutorial for
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/lisa05/">USENIX LISA 2005</a>,
or perhaps a
hands-on serial and Conserver workshop, which would require some
refocusing
of my time and effort.)</p>

<p><b>Update, Winter 2004:</b> It was time to upgrade
the site, my
testbeds, the pages, and start outlining a new tutorial. Plenty of
rainy days for my rainy day projects.</p>

<p>The testbed was expanded from one rack to three, so I can keep
more equipment cabled and ready for testing. I have been expanding
the pool of test gear, and a Netra CPU arrived in early March,
courtesy of Sun Microsystems! The website is being reorganized
structurally, and many page updates are being made. Expect a new look
in the Spring. My <a href="Cisco/ciscocons.html">Cisco
Connection
Guide</a> has been significantly reworked. Check it out if you
use
Cisco gear. The Greater and Minor Scroll pages are currently being
overhauled, expect new pages soon.</p>

<p>The serial info database that drive my
<a href="gsock.html#guides">Host-to-Adapter guides</a>
has nearly 600
records now, thanks to a day at Wierd Stuff Warehouse in Sunnyvale,
CA. There's probably another 30-50 devices I can add, when I can
afford to spend another day there.</p>

<p>I've been working on an <a href="Tracers/tracers.html#homemade">RJ-45 passive signal
tracer</a>, primarily for checking the RJ-45 console and aux
ports on Cisco gear, but there are some basic similarities
between the Cisco RJ-45 schema, and the schema used by Xyplex,
iTouch, MRV, and Cyclades and others, so my design has been working
to incorporate these. More information will be published on a <a href="Tracers/tracers.html">Passive Signal Tracer</a>
page soon...</p>

<p><b>Update, Summer 2004:</b> This summer brought
some Good News and
some Bad News. Fortunately the good is helping to offset the bad.
</p>

<p>First, the Bad News. The FileMaker Pro database I have been
using
to create my adapter information pages was on a machine without a
Floppy, and no other writable removable media. (OK, I should have
bought a USB Flash Disk for the Mac, but I was holding out for a
large Flash disk that would play well in both the Mac and Win*
worlds. I waited too long...) The hard disk ate all it's data in
early July, and I'm fortunate that most of my web pages, and the
export file from the DB survived on the web server. I have 88 percent
of the data recovered, and I'm still trying to re-collect info on the
remaining 48 devices, before I can finish rebuilding the database and
lookups.</p>

<p>But, there is Good News, too. Thanks to help from Robert
Gutierez,
Venkatesh Krishnamurti, Jeff Komori, Cary Roberts, and others, I've
recaptured a bunch of devices, but I've also managed to add more than
50 new devices to the database! And in late June, I managed to
purchase a
<b><a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/d200spec.htm">DLM200</a></b>
Serial Protocol Analyzer, from
<b><a href="http://www.protocolanalyser.com/">Benedict
Computer</a></b>. I'd been hoping someone would offer an
older HP, or
a NavTel, or perhaps I'd find a simple, inexpensive async analyzer.
But, I finally started looking for something I could afford, and my
searching found these folks practically in my back yard. It was more
than I needed, but the price was worth it. PLUS, now that I'm
rebuilding the database, and revisiting a bunch of equipment, now I
have something that can auto-detect the communications speed and
parity (in either direction, up to 56 Kbps), without needing to lug a
laptop around. I'm now much happier with my purchase, and I'm using
features that hadn't been at the top of my 'needs' list. The
database, and my web pages, will be better off because of this
purchase. I think this was money well spent.</p>

<p><b>Update, Spring 2004:</b> Word came to me that
<a href="http://www.dnpg.com/">Digital Networks</a>
(which grew from
the roots of Digital Equipment Corp.) is bringing out some newer
versions of the hallowed
<a href="http://www.dnpg.com/products-decserver.htm">DECserver</a>.
I've just tested a DECserver 90+M (8-port), and it is BREAK safe, and
has support for reverse-TCP connections. The documentation for this
feature is covered in the Management Guide and the Command Guide PDF
docs. I liked the docs, too! Good examples (more useful because they
have MANY options and features related to port configuration).</p>

<p>In the March 2004 issue of Sys Admin, I found an ad for
<a href="http://www.thinklogical.com/">Logical Solutions</a>,
and
their website talks about a new R-series "Secure" version of their
Sentinel series being BREAK-safe, and
<a href="http://www.cyclades.com/">Cyclades</a> has
an ad, plus an
item in the New Products section regarding their <b>PM</b>
series
power management units (serial controlled power outlets). The PM
series is useful enough, but Cyclades has also managed to integrate
control of the outlets with access to consoles, to the point where
you can work on a console, an then easily change the power state from
the same interface (when using Cyclades console servers), making it a
bit easier to "try to take over the world".
<a href="http://www.lantronix.com/">Lantronix</a>
also had an ad in
the back.</p>

<p>Bryan Stansell is using the <b>Cyclades ACS1</b>
these days, for
Conserver development work. My Road Warrior kit now includes an
8-port fast Ethernet switch (Allied Telesyn AT-FS708LE) and a
<b>Cyclades TS800</b> (8-port console server). Since I'm
not running
a Unix laptop, I use PuTTY or NCSA telnet to get to the serial ports,
with a couple ethernet cables and many adapters. This works really
well, and the parts fit nicely in the computer bag.</p>

<p>I've also seen a 4-port console server with a built-in modem
from
<b>MRV Communications</b> (the
<a href="http://www.mrv.com/product/MRV-IR-027/">LX-1000S</a>),
which
includes a lot of cool dial-up support, such as PAP, CHAP, and SSH.
I'm told it's BREAK-safe, by someone I trust, but I haven't tested
this myself.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Update, Spring 2003:</b> Word has reached me
that the Computone
product line is being revived! Development went dormant last summer
as new management changed directions at Computone. However,
<a href="http://www.alturaxl.com/">Altura XL</a> has
bought the
Intelliserver&reg; RAS 2000 hardware line, and they are continuing
development of these products.</p>
