<P><B>Finding Time To Do It All</B></P>

<P>During the past few years, we have seen an explosive growth in the
number of companies that depend on the Internet for the success of
their business. For those of us who work to support the systems and
networks, we can look forward to stable employment. But the success
of our companies means more work to do, and it is becoming harder to
find additional qualified technical people to hire. As a result, we
need to learn to do more with less. This story will tell you about
one tool that saves me time, reduces downtime, speeds
troubleshooting, and aids in the training of new staff. (Oh yeah,
it's also free!)</P>

<P>Thomas A. Fine and Steven Romig presented a client-server
application called Conserver at LISA IV (Fall 1990,
[<A HREF="#footnotes">1</A>]). Conserver allowed administrators
around the network to have access to serial console ports using the
telnet protocol between the client and server, and the server would
log all of the session activity coming from each console. This
application saved Ohio State University space, power, and cooling by
removing many of the monitors and keyboards that used to be attached
to the servers in their data center. It also saved them a great deal
of running to the server room every time they needed to make a change
on the physical console! I'm happy to report that Conserver has been
getting better over time.</P>

<P>During the past decade, the Conserver application has evolved
[<A HREF="#footnotes">2</A>], based on the needs and feedback of the
users. Terminal servers, as a product class, have also evolved during
this decade, and many now allow telnet-like (socket-based) and
secure-shell (ssh) access from networked hosts to individual serial
ports. This extends the reach of the administrators to the far
corners of their network, including control of devices that do not
have network connections (such as CSU/DSU equipment, test and
diagnostic devices, to name only a few).</P>

<P>Conserver is distributed freely
[<A HREF="http://www.conserver.com/">3</A>], but the serial ports you
use with it, unfortunately, are not. While a terminal server can
provide remote access to serial console ports, the cost-per-port to
deploy them has been high, and is currently still higher than the
cost of a 10/100 switch port. There are many advantages to be gained
by deploying terminal servers in your network, and I will outline
some of the best reasons in this article. I have found the benefits
well worth the cost of deployment, especially in terms of the speed
of recovery from outages. And in todays e-commerce world, some
outages can be downright costly, in terms of lost sales, not to
mention customer perception.</P>

<P>When your hosts won't boot, access to the serial console port
becomes invaluable, but the serial console can also be useful in your
change control procedures. Once your hosts are up and running, the
administrator(s) will have many options for remote access to them to
control their functions. But those avenues of access can mean that
multiple administrators (or users with administrative access) will
have simultaneous ability to the change settings on the host. This
suggests that you also need to consider good change control
practices, to prevent many administrators from making changes on top
of each other. If the administrators all share access to a single
console of a host, they will know whether they have exclusive access
to make their changes. Conserver can help whether the host is up or
down.</P>

<P><B>Considering the alternatives</B></P>

<P>You may have a bunch of hosts, connected to monitors and
keyboards. The monitors all take up space, use power and create extra
heat when they are turned on. If you aren't watching all the time,
you probably rely on the scrollback in some of the GUI windows on
each host. The cost of each 15" screen and keyboard approaches the
cost for a terminal server port. In a large data center, add in the
cost of air conditioning capacity for all those monitors. (You
probably don't want more than a few display devices in a large data
center.)</P>

<P>Keyboard/video/mouse (K/V/M) switch systems allow you to connect
many hosts to a single display device. You'll find the cost of K/V/M
ports are close to the cost of a terminal server port if you are
attaching PCs, and the cost is significantly higher to attach UNIX
workstations (Sun, SGI, etc.) to a K/V/M switch. Don't forget the
complication of screen resolutions, and scan rates! You can't get
more than 12-18 devices on a big switch. While you can cascade the
switches, it still doesn't scale for large data centers. You can find
more information about K/V/M switches from the Celeste Stokely System
Administration web site [<A HREF="http://www.stokely.com/">4</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.stokely.com/unix.serial.port.resources/tutorials.html">5</A>].
</P>

<P>VT-type terminals (or a terminal emulation window on a host)
connected to a multi-port switchbox give you text-only (CLI) support
for much less money than a K/V/M, but you don't get GUI access when
the host is up. The average cost for switchboxes with 8 ports will
cost you about the same as one terminal server port. Your limitations
here include the physical distance for the serial console lines
between hosts and the switchbox, as well as the number of devices you
can attach to the switchbox. You can cascade these devices to gain
more ports per terminal, but the length limitation is still there,
plus you need to know which switch combinations will connect you to
the port that you want.</P>

<P>Terminal servers generate less heat than your average monitor,
take up one network port, and allow you to access any serial port
that you connect from anywhere on your network via a telnet session.
Most units only take 1-2 rack units of vertical space to mount. Many
sessions can be open to different ports at the same time, unlike most
of the other alternatives above. (There are many websites that show
how to connect various devices to various vendors terminal servers
[<A HREF="http://www.stokely.com/unix.serial.port.resources/tutorials.html">5</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/">6</A>].) The disadvantages to
using terminal servers include the price, and the fact that there is
no logging inherent in the terminal servers. If you were not
connected to a console and watching, the data coming from each
connected host is lost.</P>

<P>Adding the (free) Conserver application to a deployment of
terminal servers adds the logging option, as well as adding a
mentoring capacity, provides access control (and auditing of access)
to the console ports, thus increasing the overall value of the
deployment to the administrators.</P>

<P><B>The value of remote console access</B></P>

<P>If you are one of a few (or the only one) who carries a pager to
respond to outages around your network, then remote access to your
consoles should be one of the tools at your disposal. This gives you
the ability to sit at any workstation (even dialed in from home) and
be on the physical console of any connected host. This gives you
faster visibility into your problem, and faster time to resolution,
than if you needed to return to the data center to get to a terminal
or keyboard. Do you remember a time when you were less than ten
minutes from home, your pager went off, and you had to fight traffic
back to the office to fix some problem? What would it be worth to you
to keep driving home and get on the console remotely, with your
dinner at your side?</P>

<P>Let's consider the benefits of deploying terminal servers for
remote access to consoles, then we'll discuss the extra benefits of
adding the Conserver software.</P>

<P>Terminal Server-Only Communications Overview</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Device console ports are attached to terminal servers on the
   network.
   
   <LI>The administrator uses a telnet session to connect to a
   specific serial port.
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Telnet session is from admin's system to the terminal
      server.
      
      <LI>Only one session at a time can be connected to each serial
      port.
      
      <LI>If no session is connected to a port, data from the
      attached device is lost.
   </UL>
</UL>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../termserver1.gif" WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=112

<P>Imagine that you get home and access the console on the downed
host. You hit return, and there is no response. If there is someone
at the office whom you can call, you can ask them to cycle the power
on your host, while you stay at home and watch the boot cycle. (Even
if you don't have after-hours staff in the office there are power
strips with serial ports
[<A HREF="http://www.baytechdcd.com/products/rpcseries.shtml">7</A>],
and/or ethernet ports with telnet and/or http interfaces
[<A HREF="http://www.apcc.com/products/masterswitch/index.cfm">8</A>],
to let you control power to individual outlets. You can cycle the
power yourself, from home!)</P>

<P>Do you need to escort administrators into restricted areas, just
for simple machine reset? We use console access to allow system
administrators to control their hosts which need to live in a lab
with restricted physical access. The ability to provide them with
remote access to power-cycle the device as well as control the
console has eliminated the need to allow non-essential staff to have
physical access to security-sensitive areas.</P>

<P>While most UNIX hosts provide a method to use serial consoles
instead of a video display and keyboard, your average PC platform
does not have this built into the BIOS. While a UNIX kernel running
on a PC will eventually allow you to use a serial port for a console,
it isn't active until the kernel has booted, so you normally cannot
see the Power-On Self Test information. But PC platform users do have
some options!</P>

<P>Some PC server makers are modifying the BIOS to provide the
ability to redirect the results of the Power-On Self Test (POST) to a
serial port. Network Engines has recently added this, while Compaq
has had this ability for about a year. Hewlett-Packard has an
optional system management card that you can add to their servers.
There are no standards for this type of console access, so the
features for each vendor are different, and you should ask your
vendor about the features they offer.</P>

<P>TIP: If your server vendor includes console redirection in BIOS,
you should understand the limitations of their implementation. For
example, the Network Engines BIOS hands off the startup to
intelligent hard disk controllers, and ethernet NICs, and the output
from those interfaces is NOT redirected. If there are problems posted
by those controllers, you will not see them through BIOS redirection
in the current implementation.</P>

<P>If you use a PC that doesn't have console support in the BIOS, but
it does have a spare ISA slot, you can consider using the PC Weasel
2000 add-in card [<A HREF="http://www.realweasel.com">9</A>]. This
appears to the server as a monochrome display adapter, but it
translates the characters sent to the pseudo-screen into characters
on a serial port. The PC Weasel also includes hardware that senses
when your OS tries to use the serial port for its console, and it
connects the serial port on the card to the operating system. The
card also monitors the serial stream for a special sequence coming
into the console, which allows the administrators to talk to the PC
Weasel again to restart the PC (or the PC Weasel). Their web site has
an online demo.</P>

<P><B>Added value from free software</B></P>

<P>Let's visit that downed host again. You connected to the console
port, hit return, and nothing came back. What caused it to stop? If
nobody was connected and watching, anything the host had sent to the
console was lost. The logging capability of a console server
application is one of the best reasons to combine it with your
terminal servers.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../Clues/conserver1.gif" WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=112
X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P>

<P>With Conserver in this equation, you connect to the downed host,
press return, and get nothing back. Then you use a few meta-keystokes
to replay the last 20 or 60 lines of the log for that device to your
session. This will usually tell you why it stopped (bad memory, full
disk, other problems), and this may affect your decision to just
cycle the power. You may decide that something needs to be fixed
before you bring it up again.</P>

<P>You can deploy terminal servers, and distributed console servers,
across the country, and even internationally. This can be an
important tool if you have to support smaller, remote offices without
administrators on-site. Sure, you can pre-configure a new host for a
remote office, and even set it up in a test lab. You can include
diagrams and documentation for the remote office staff, directing
them how to unpack it and plug it in. But when they follow your
instructions, and you can't connect to it, what do you do? Before you
can talk someone through fixing the problem, you need to troubleshoot
it.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Is it powered?
   
   <LI>Is the network connection plugged into the correct interface?
   
   <LI>Is there a duplicate network address in the office?
   
   <LI>Did the network switch auto-negotiate to the wrong speed?
   
   <LI>Was the disk damaged in shipment?
   
   <LI>What will the remote office folks use for a console, in order
   to be your eyes?
</UL>

<P>If you had it plugged into a terminal server port in that office,
you could get most of those answers yourself, rather than talking the
office staff through the troubleshooting steps. (Now how much is that
terminal server worth to you?)</P>

<P>You can find links to a number of console server applications on
the [<A HREF="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/">6</A>], but my favorite
application is currently Conserver
[<A HREF="http://www.conserver.com/">3</A>] for a number of reasons;
</P>

<P>1) Conserver allows you to control devices attached to serial
ports connected to the Conserver host, as well as to serial ports on
terminal servers scattered throughout your network.</P>

<P>2) Everything that comes out of a device's console port goes into
the Conserver log file for that device.</P>

<P>3) Single-user control, but multi-user viewing, makes Conserver an
excellent mentoring tool. Control can be easily switched between
users, allowing collaboration between administrators in different
locations.</P>

<P>We have used Conserver during maintenance downtimes, along with a
conference call, to allow a standby administrator to hear and watch
the progress of an upgrade session. This was done because the person
making the changes was across the country, while the standby person
was at his desk in the same building as the equipment, in case the
hardware failed during the changes.</P>

<P>4) The log files for various devices can also be used as a
teaching tool, as a junior administrator can look through sessions to
see how a senior administrator performed some tasks, providing that
your security policies and the file permissions allow this.
(Conserver logs the data coming in from the attached host, not the
data going from clients to the host.)</P>

<P>You can also use Conserver logs for training after a failure. If a
junior-level administrator started the troubleshooting, and a senior
had to come in later and follow up, both administrators can benefit.
The senior can look at the logs, and see what was already done
(including looking to see what happened before the failure). The
junior can watch the senior, and perhaps learn new methods to use the
next time.</P>

<P>5) Scripting tools can also sift through the logs, looking for
problems, as a backup to your other automated device managers. These
includes SWATCH
[<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~atkins/swatch/">10</A>], presented
at LISA in 1993.</P>

<P>6) The logs can also provide additional logging, as a backup to
your syslog files. (A cracker can find out where you are sending
syslog messages, but the host doesn't require any special pointers to
the Conserver host in order to be connected and logged, so a cracker
would not know there was another log to clean up after an intrusion.)
</P>

<P>We have found syslog settings misconfigured on some hosts more
than once using the Conserver logs. While one machine kept quietly
rebooting at random intervals, the administrators found nothing in
the syslog files, yet the conserver logs told two stories...first,
the cause of the rebooting was a failure to write to a full file
system; second, the fact that syslog wasn't logging the errors led us
to check the syslog configurations.</P>

<P>7) If a device attached to your Conserver doesn't timestamp it's
output, Conserver can be set up to put an hourly timestamp in the log
for that device.</P>

<P>8) Multiple distributed Conserver hosts can be controlled by a
single configuration file, which specifies which servers are
connected to the various hosts and devices. This provides easy
configuration, even when you deploy Conservers in remote offices.
</P>

<P>TIP: Deploying a Conserver host at each remote office means that
console data won't be lost if a WAN link fails. If you allow remote
access to the remote office, you can look at the logs during the link
failure to see what activity may have happened, and keep an eye on
your link providers work during the repair.</P>

<P>If the WAN link to a remote office goes down, you can still dial
into a modem attached to the terminal server in that office, pass the
authentication challenge, allowing the network administrator to look
at the CSU/DSU and router on both ends of the failing link at once.
</P>

<P>9) You can't use grep(1) on a pile of paper on the back end of a
DECWriter! But you can use it on the log files from Conserver.</P>

<P>TIP: As with syslog and backups, keeping the clocks between all of
your Conserver-connected systems in sync is very important. We
recommend a stable NTP infrastructure be in place when you deploy a
console server. During large problem events (denial of service
attacks, network outages, cascading failures across multiple
servers), your troubleshooting will be faster if all of the clocks
are in sync. This allows you to correlate time stamps between various
hosts and network devices, and understand what happened first, and
what happened after that. (Consider using one time zone for all hosts
if making the time zone conversions for troubleshooting is a concern
for you.)</P>

<P>The maintainer of Conserver and I will present a half-day tutorial
about deploying remote serial console access at the LISA conference
[<A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa2000/">11</A>] in
December. We invite anyone with an interest in the topic to sign up.
We will be covering several models for deploying Conserver, and we'll
try to take the mystery out of connecting various serial devices to
your terminal servers.</P>

<P>There are also options that you can use for added security, but
architecture also plays a part in that discussion. Deployment models
vary, depending on the security needs. Bring your questions to LISA,
and look for the Conserver BoF session!</P>

<P><B>What about the BREAK problem?</B></P>

<P>If you have Sun hosts, you may have been warned away from
attaching terminal servers for remote access. Let me offer a brief
explanation, and some information that may help.</P>

<P>There is a serial port equivalent to the telnet BREAK signal,
where the data lead signal is inverted from its normal state for a
brief period of time (more than the duration of a single character,
including start and stop bits) [12]. This is not the same as sending
control characters. Most terminal servers send a serial BREAK to
every port when you turn the power off, and some even do it when you
turn power on, or during their boot sequence. This problem also
exists on most multi-port add-in cards for PCs.</P>

<P>When Sun machines receive a serial BREAK, they will drop down to
the "ok&gt;" prompt. This stops the operating system, and all the
useful services that the machine is doing at the time, until someone
gets on the console and types "go". This is actually quite useful for
getting the machine out of a hung state, so you normally don't want
to block this signal. Newer versions of SunOS either allow a patch
[13], or include in the OS, the ability to ignore the serial BREAK
but listen for a specific character sequence instead. Sun customers
with SunSolve [<A HREF="http://sunsolve.sun.com/">14</A>] support
access can check SunSolve for more information.</P>

<P>The problem occurs when you have a bunch of Sun hosts connected to
a terminal server, and then the terminal server sends a BREAK to all
of the attached hosts...and everything stops until you get on each of
the consoles and type "go" for each host. (You can infer why it would
be a bad idea to plug the console of your Conserver host into a
terminal server that you access through that Conserver.)</P>

<P>Cisco Systems has also posted a Field Notice related to the BREAK
problem to a web page
[<A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/770/fn-tsbreak.html">15</A>]
in April of 1998. The basic idea behind the notice was trying to keep
the BREAK signal from getting to the Sun host, or make the Sun host
ignore the signal. Unfortunately, the signal is too useful to
administrators, so we can't advocate methods that block the BREAK
signal from getting to the host.</P>

<P>Our search for a good answer has led us to try to find terminal
servers which don't send BREAK at inopportune times. In support of
Mark Burgess's series of articles (Systems Administration Research)
in the recent versions of ;login:, I have started a series of tests
on a variety of terminal server models. We're posting our test
methods as well as the results, and encouraging other sites with an
interest to perform similar tests and share their results with us.
We're trying to determine whether the failures for various vendors
are related to hardware or software; when you can expect the failure
to occur; and trying various recommended settings on the terminal
servers to try to eliminate the problem. You can find more
information on our results page
(<A HREF="http://www.conserver.com/consoles/breakoff.html">16</A>).</P>

<P><B>In Summary</B></P>

<P>If you have always worked at a site with remote access to the
serial consoles, consider yourself lucky. If you don't have some type
of access now, I hope I've given you some reasons to consider adding
it soon. If I've managed to interest you in the subject, but you want
to learn more, I hope to see you in the tutorial in December.</P>

<P>I believe it was Elizabeth Zwicky who wrote a series of articles
about software that should have been included in our favorite
operating systems. I think Conserver belongs in that category.</P>

         <P>All of the authors and contributors work for
         <A HREF="http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty
         Solutions</A>. (Prior to August 2000, Certainty Solutions

         <P>David K. Z. Harris has been a network plumber "for more
         than a decade", and he likes many kinds of puzzles. He's
         been a member of the Technical Staff for nearly three years.
         Connecting various devices together (like making networks
         work, or hooking up serial consoles) is just another
         interesting puzzle.</P>
         
         <P>Bryan Stansell is one of the earliest members of staff,
         and is the current keeper of the Conserver code, as an
         extension of his love of computers and programming.</P>
         
         <P>David Stuit, and Michael Batchelder also provided
         substantial material for, and review of, this article.
