<p>I'll also be submitting a proposal to USENIX, to teach a serial
tutorial at LISA this winter. I won't know if that's been accepted 
until late summer, so check back here often. (If you want to attend
such a course a LISA, email the tutorial coordinators and let them
hear from you.)

<P>In addition to the tutorials and presentations listed below, I'm
also a co-author of 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1880548135/qid%3D907622698/sr%3D1-5/002-0366590-6587206">Mastering
Network Management</a>, (ISBN: 1880548135, November 1995, Numidia Press).</P>

<P>I have created short-course training and tutorials for more than a dozen
clients, as well as updating the basic curriculum for the University of
California at Santa Cruz Extension &quot;Computer Science <i>Network
Management</i>&quot;, where I was also one of the top-ten instructors
(based on student feedback to the University). Some of these presentations
are being made available for downlad on this server.  All the files are

<P><a href="Consoles.101.PPT">Consoles.101.PPT</a> - Created for presentation
to the <a href="http://www.scte.org/home.cfm">Society of Cable Televion 
Engineers (SCTE)</a>
<a href="http://www.scte.org/goldengate/">Golden Gate chapter</a>, with a 
focus on the needs of the cable industry in 2000 (a slightly different focus 
than for System and Network Administrators). This was created while I was the
Broadband Architect at <a href=http://www.certaintysolutions.com">Certainty 
Solutions, Inc.</a>, but was never scheduled for presentation.</P>

<P><a href="login-story.html">login-story.html</a> - Published in
the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> journal 
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/"><b>;login:</b></a>,
in October 2000, and that issue was available for free to any attendees 
that were present at the LISA 2000 conference.
(<a href="login-story.txt">login-story.txt</a> is the initial outline 
for the article submission to USENIX, if you care to see the difference.)</P>

<p>A Full-Day Tutorial, in two sections, designed for the
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a>&nbsp;
<b><a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa2000/">LISA 2000</a></b>
(<b>L</b>arge <b>I</b>nstallation <b>S</b>ystems <b>A</b>dministration) 
conference in December 2000.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="M12-1.PDF">M12-1.PDF</a> - Basic serial connectivity, and
  some Serial BREAK information, and remote access to consoles using
  terminal/console servers.</P>
  <li><a href="M12-2.PDF">M12-2.PDF</a> - Crash course on 
  <a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver</a> (with a focus on
  the <b>GNAC</b> version of the distribution, and recent changes),
  including an overview of logging client/server applications for
  remote access to serial consoles.</P>
</ul>

<p>Two Half-Day Tutorials, designed for the
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a>&nbsp;
<b><a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa2002/">LISA 2002</a></b>
conference in November 2002</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="LISA2002-T9.PDF">LISA2002-T9.PDF</a> - Getting Up To
  Speed on Console Servers, deployment techniques, including getting
  a basic <a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver</a> installation
  running.</P>
  <li><a href="LISA2002-T12.PDF">LISA2002-T12.PDF</a> - Advanced Remote
  Console Access, looking at the security aspects, updates on vendors
  and hardware inprovements, and tuned during class to meet the needs
  of the students, addressing problems they were facing then.</P>
</ul>

<p>I'm also considering whether to try to present another tutorial
at LISA in 2005, or if it might be better to present a hands-on
workshop on a serial console / Conserver / debugging topic instead.
(If you have any feelings one way or another, please drop me an
email to <b>Consoles</b> at <!-- SPAM_crawler obstruction -->
<B>conserver.com</b> and tell me which you would prefer, class
or workshop.)</p>

<P><a href="BayLISA-consoles.ppt">BayLISA-consoles.ppt</a> - This is a
basic overview (&quot;<i>fast and low</i>&quot;) on the topics of
remote access to serial consoles, using a logging server (like Conserver)
and the benefits that you get, and discussing the state of security
for the remote sessions, for the <a href="http://www.baylisa.org">BayLISA</a>
(the Bay Area Large Installation Systems Administration group) in
January 2003.</P>
