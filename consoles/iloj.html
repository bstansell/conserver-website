<h2 align="center">How I've built these pages...</h2>

<h4 align="center">http://www.conserver.com/consoles/iloj.html<br>

(updated:Sunday, 06-Jan-2008 16:09:24 PST )</h4>

<p>First, the short answers;
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Photos: Canon PowerShot Pro A70, 1.2 Mpixel camera<br>

imported using <a href="http://www.ziocorp.com/products/CFReaders.html">Zio
Corp.s *Dazzle</a> USB 2.0 Media reader (under Mac OS X),<br>

or <a href="http://www.memoryxflash.com/store/catalog/USB-20-Memory-Card-Reader-Flash-Memory-Card-Writer-9in4.html">mediaGear</a>
9-in-4 CF reader (under Windows 2000). </li>

  <li>Image annotation, manipulation: I usued to use Adobe
ImageReady 1.0<br>

(This is also my primary tool for animated GIFs! It's Excellent, but
doesn't run under OS X.)<br>

Now I'm using <a href="http://www.xtralean.com/">ImageWell</a>,
primarily for cropping, and <a href="http://www.purgatorydesign.com/">Intaglio</a>
for annotation. </li>

  <li>Illustration Art: Originally in MacDraw, then MacDraw II,<br>

then migrated most files into CLARIS Draw Pro<br>

currently using <a href="" http://www.purgatorydesign.com="">Intaglio</a>
under OS X (native app!). </li>

  <li>Web Page initial design and layout: CLARIS HomePage v 2.0<br>

(Still a great tool for lightweight HTML, color and image layout)<br>

it works <b>much better</b> under older Mac OS, than under
OS X.<br>

Under Mac OS X, I now use <a href="http://www.nvu.com/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nvu</span></a><br>

Minor tweaks and tuning using <b>vim</b> </li>

  <li>Database: FileMaker Pro, versions 2, then 4, and now <a href="http://www.filemaker.com/">version 7</a><br>

(Supporting my Host-to-Adapter pages, and the BREAK-off testing.) </li>

  <li>Dynamic Web Pages: PERL (what else?)<br>

(This creates the host-to-adapter pages, and related Palm Docs, from
the database info.) </li>

  <li>PalmDoc generation: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bibelot/">Bibelot.pl</a>,
by John Fulmer.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Now, a bit more detail, for those who want more...</p>

<p>I've prefered Apple Macintosh products for my creative
efforts, and
my first web pages were created on a DUO 230 (greyscale screen, so I
had
to guess about colors, and then check the HTML in a variety of browsers
until I found colors I liked). The greyscale screen was actually a
Good Thing, as it made me conscious of how various colors would be
displayed on greyscale screens, as well as greyscale printers. Since
I was a proponent of using color to communicate, I learned early on
about checking my work for compatability on older, less-fancy gear.</p>

<p>While working at Network Equipment Technologies in the late
80's,
I was a volunteer in the N.E.T. Mac Technical Assisitance Center, where
I was a specialist with Filemaker (then a CLARIS tool) and Mac Draw. As
a tech support specialist for a large company (read: a large
corporate Macintosh User Base), I had a chance to buy one copy of each
of the CLARIS products for a
great discount, so I jumped at the chance. As a result, I became
knowledgable on all of their applications (which was their goal in
granting the discounts). This was when I upgraded to CLARIS Draw Pro.</p>

<p>Over time, I bought more Macs for home, with color screens,
but
I kept my pages on the DUO for many more years. I finally upgraded
to a DUO 280C (color screen) with a bigger disc in the mid-90's.
In 2000, I upgraded to a DUO 2300 (color, PowerPC), but the screen
died in 2002. Since then, I've mainly maintained the pages with
an iMac DV, running OS 9, using all of the same applications.</p>

<p>In 2004, the iMac drive died, taking most of the changes of
the previous two years with it. While the website remained, it
was the output of some scripts, but the core databases were lost.
I rebuilt them from files on the 2300's hard disk, but then I
needed to fill in the gaps of the past couple years.</p>

<p>When I recovered the drive, I installed OS X (10.3) instead
of OS 9. While I enjoy the linux-like computer underneath, I've
found a few issues with running older apps in "Classic Mode" (OS 9
emulation). The Adobe ImageReady performs pretty well, so far, and will
remain as a mainstay tool. CLARIS HomePage and
CLARIS Draw, however, are too old, and were not designed to
integrate well with the Classic Mode emulator. As a result, it's a lot
of extra work to get existing files into the app
for editing. It's still a useful tool, however, for creating
new pages, and I'll continue to hack with it for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.purgatorydesign.com/"><b>Intaglio</b></a>
initially interested me, because I wanted a draw tool that would open
my older artwork and illustration
files. Version 1.x would open PICT resource files, but I still had to
work in CLARIS Draw and MacDraw (in Classis Mode...) to
export older files as PICT pages, and then open them in Intaglio.
It was a lot of work, and the outcomes weren't perfect. However,
version 2.2 will open the CLARIS Draw files directly(!), and the
results are GREAT. Also, I can select a portion of a page now,
such as the schematic for a single adapter, and "save selection
as...", choose JPEG, and I can kick out the new illustrations
faster than the old way (which was to paste them into a new
image in ImageReady, and then save it as a GIF).</p>

<p>I'll occasionally continue to use ImageReady for animating GIF
images and
photo annotation. (ImageReady was so popular, it became a 'bundled'
tool with Photoshop. Unfortunately, the cost of Photoshop was too
high for me, and the feature set of Photoshop was too much for my
needs, so I have never upgraded this app. Fortunately, ImageReady
does a good job, doing the things that I needed it to do, so it
was worth my initial investment. If you can use more of the power
in Photoshop, consider looking for the bundle with ImageReady!)</p>

<p>I've now moved into an Apple Mac Mini, and the newer versions
of OS X don't come with OS 9, so I'm still using the iMac DV for using
ImageReady, and older apps. I'm now using <a href="http://www.nvu.com/">Nvu</a> to compose web
pages, <a href="http://www.xtralean.com/">ImageWell</a>
to crop and adjust photos, and <a href="http://www.purgatorydesign.com/">Intaglio</a>
for the line art, adapter drawings, and image annotation.</p>

<p>I'm just scratching the surface on the vast feature set of
FileMaker
Pro version 7, and a couple features for 'relational databases' have
made it a bit harder to recreate my old databases in the new
application.
But, the results have been worth the work. </p>

<p>As I rebuild and upgrade my website, I'm also implementing a
backup
that includes burining the occassional CD, and mirroring the data to
a second site. (I'm also using a .Mac account to backup the stuff on
my Mac, so my source data is safe as well.)</p>

<p>Just to show that I'm not "just a Mac Fanatic", I'll add that
I've
had plenty of experience with early DOS through Windows XP and 2000,
as well as a few flavors of Solaris on older SUN and newer SPARC gear,
as well as X-terms, diskless computing, and special-purpose hybrids.
Out of all of this experience, I simply prefer to use a Mac at home.</p>

<p>The <a href="BREAK-off/breakoff.html">BREAK-off
testbed</a> is a
collection of Mac, Intel, and Sun hardware. In the image below you can
see
one of my past hacking projects, trying to <a href="Cases/remotetruck.html">provision a dialup network
through a
geo-stationary satellite link</a>. Note the PC in the foreground,
and the Sun
SPARC to the right side of the frame. Also note the picture hanging on
the wall,
