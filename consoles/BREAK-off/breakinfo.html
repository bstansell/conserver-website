      <p>Our testing, to date, has shown that serial BREAK
usually occurs at power-off, if it does occur. (We have some cases
where the devices sent BREAK at power-on, but some of these cases were
due to power issues while others were due to the software
initialization routines.) This page will document information about
the console servers we have tested which will send BREAK when
you need it, without sending surprise BREAKs when you reset the units,
or power cycle the console servers.</p>

      <ul>

        <p><i>Most of the power-related BREAK issues
stemmed from the use of multiple-voltage RS-232 driver interface I.C.s,
and the switch-mode power supplies in the terminal servers. The power
supplies have a 'logic' power rail, and then other positive and
negative power rails (typically +/- 12 VDC). The +/- supply is what
provides the RS-232 output signals. When the supply loses power, the
'logic' power rail falls more quickly (due to a larger current load),
and the other power rails retain their voltage a bit longer. So, when
logic level going into the RS-232 driver falls, the power for the
output is still there a bit longer, and this makes the RS-232 output
shift, long enough to appear to be a serial BREAK signal.</i></p>

      <p><b>Why we are doing this testing:</b></p>

      <p>We started this project because finding information on
whether or not a device has the serial BREAK problem was more like
tracking down an urban legend than science. Even with high confidence
in a device, you can usually find someone who will suggest that some
unidentified third party has had some trouble with that same device in
the past. We have posted our test methodologies on a 
<a href="breaktest.html">separate web page</a>. </p>

</p>

<p>I do realize that good science relies on larger sample pools.
We
are continuing to solicit loaner equipment that we can put through
our testbed. As we run out of easy access to equipment, we will begin
to accept more offers from other teams at universities and other
large sites to perform this testing on their own gear using our test
methods. We'll review their test results, and add those results to
our database as 'external data' submissions, in order to identify
which testing we have performed personally. In some cases, the
manufacturers are contacting us directly now, which has made it
easier to get equipment loaned for testing. (Manufacturers may want
to look at the <a href="breakfaq.html">Frequently Asked
Questions</a>
page for information about how to inquire about testing.</p>

<p>Our initial test run was intended to help prove how many
devices had software-related causes versus hardware-related causes, and
which devices do not exhibit the problem. (A side effect of the testing
was that we could be confident about certain hardware, when suggesting
the devices to customers that have BREAK-sensitive equipment.)</p>

      <p><b>Devices that work with Conserver, and don't
have the BREAK Problem</b></p>

      <p>We have not found any add-in cards for Intel-based
servers which do not send BREAK when the PC is power-cycled. We have
seen mixed results with a combination of in-chassis card with
externally-powered interface pods (Cyclades PR series, Digi
PortServer). If you have information about hardware that does well,
please let us know.</p>

      <p>Since our initial interest was to find devices that we
could use with the Conserver application, and which would be compatible
with Sun machines, this has been the main focus of the testing. The
devices that we will recommend at this point;</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Cisco 2800</b> and <b>3800</b>
series units with the <b>HWIC-xxA</b> async modules.<br>

(While you can use reverse-TCP to reach the AUX ports on these units,
be aware that the AUX and CON ports <b>WILL</b> send BRAKE
when these units lose power.)</p>

        <p><b>Cisco 2600</b> and <b>3600</b>
series units, with the <b>NM-xxA</b> async modules.<br>

(We have three reports of possible BREAK problems on different 3660
chassis, but we have not determined what adapters/wiring they were
using. In two cases, using a Cisco adapter resolved the problem, but I
haven't received the adapters that failed (or a diagram of how they
were wired). If I get more info, I'll post it, but we've had good luck
with
more than three dozen 3600 series devices in long-term service.)</p>

Hardware that Conserver doesn't work with...</b></p>

      <p>We have found a class of hardware that provides remote
access to console services, but doesn't allow a method for Conserver to
connect to each serial port. While providing useful features, it
doesn't allow Conserver an ability to connect at high TCP ports, to add
the logging and multi-user access features.</p>

      <p>Rather than list everything that falls into this
category, I'll simply list the gear that doesn't have the BREAK
problem, since I can imagine there are reasons that some sites may want
to use this hardware, even without the benefits of Conserver.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Lightwave Communications 3200</b></p>

        <p>This unit supports 4 ports per card, and allowed
telnet and SSH to the unit, but you need to use the Command Line
Interface (CLI) to talk to the ports. Each port provides a cyclic 64 KB
scrollback buffer, but there is no long-term logging in the unit. The
feature that impressed us the most during the testing was that the unit
doesn't send BREAK at the wrong times, even if you hot-swap the async
interface cards! The unit has some other nice features, including an
LCD display on the front panel. If BREAK is a problem, and you don't
care about the long-term logging, give this device a look.</p>

      <p>Footnotes to the test results;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>We originally tested with a code revision from
mid-2000, and found that if the main unit *and* the pod lost power at
the same time, a BREAK would be sent when the main unit finished
booting, and it initialized the pod. Cycling only one or the other does
not send BREAK. <b>This problem was resolved with a software
patch. This fix was rolled into the main code tree late in December,
2000. Newer versions of code should not send BREAK.</b> (Let us
know if you do find any problems with newer code...make sure you let
Cyclades Support know as well!) </li>
        <li>We were unable to configure the Nortel ACN-200 into
an async mode, using the wiring pinouts obtained from their external
web pages. We were unsuccessful in getting the box into a debug or
config mode before we had to return the unit. </li>
        <li>Unit has an extended boot sequence (greater than 2
minutes). </li>
        <li>We've turned up a number of details about 2500 series
see the <a href="#cisco">Cisco section</a> for more
info. </li>
        <li>Cannot be used by Conserver, because it won't support
the per-port connections at high TCP ports. (<a href="#non-conserver">More
info below</a>.) </li>
        <li>This testing was made with their current production
card. We are expecting a newer version of the async card, which should
not send BREAK. </li>
        <li>The unit only sends BREAK when both the main unit and
the pod are power cycled.</li>
        <li>The HWIC-8A and HWIC-16A cards passed the test, but
the CONS and AUX ports on the chassis failed this test.</li>

<p>The Lantronix line has been evolving and expanding. (I've only
just heard that Lantronix acquired the Lightwaves products last year,
which rolls in some good high-security experience to a robust group of
hardware folks!) The SCS should have some interesting features, and I
want to try their user interface. Wiring for the Lantronix will be
easy, since they use the same RJ-45 pinouts as Cisco console ports, so
I can use my <a href="../Cisco/ciscokit.html">Cisco
adapters</a> on the Lantronix gear as well.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any other suggestions for
vendors devices that you think we should test. If you are a vendor, and
would like us to test your terminal server, please contact us (email to

Networks/Nortel information </b></p>
      <p>The (Xylogics) <b>MicroAnnex</b> was an 8-
or 16-port terminal server. These units <b>DO</b> send
BREAK.</p>
      <ul>
        <p><i>I have received word that a set of
configuration commands <b>may</b> make the Annex units <b>not</b>
send BREAK upon power-off and power-on. I have not received the set of
commands, so I have not been able to verify this. If you think you have
a set we can try, please contact us.</i></p>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Bay Networks</b> bought the Annex product
line, and they <b>fixed</b> the BREAK problem. The
MicroAnnex became the <b>Bay 2000</b>, and these work
fine! You can tell the new units as the case color changed from the
original off-white to a tan plastic/dark beige label color combination.</p>
      <p>Bay also reworked the Annex 3, calling it the <b>Bay
4000</b>, adding a redundant power supply. Unfortunately, we have
seen cases where a fully-loaded Bay 4000 chassis cannot run on a single
supply. (That is, the redundant supply isn't really redundant, but is
needed in fully-loaded chassis. If one power supply should fail, the
other power supply cannot support the full load, and the entire chassis
shuts down.)</p>
      <p><b>Nortel Networks</b> bought Bay Networks,
and the Bay 2000 became the <b>Nortel 2000</b>. The Bay
4000 became the <b>Nortel 4000</b>. Nortel decided that
the Annex line was competing with their existing Nortel products, so
they killed the Bay 2000-4000 products in the winter of 1999. The plan
was to recommend the Nortel ACN-200 as a functional replacement for
these servers.</p>
      <p>We were unable to configure the Nortel ACN-200 into an
async mode, using the wiring pinouts obtained from the Nortel external
web pages, and instructions from the product manual. The units support
less than 20 async ports, in a relatively large chassis. We were
unsuccessful in getting the box into a debug or config mode before we
had to return the unit. </p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> You should be aware that the
Console and Aux ports
on many Cisco products will send serial BREAK when the device power is
turned off. If you are connecting these devices to the serial port on a
Sun device for control or monitoring, it is possible that the Cisco
could cause the Sun device to halt when the Cisco loses power.</p>
      <p>As for other Asynch lines (other than the Console and
Aux ports), these are the the results of testing on some of the Access
products;</p>
      <p><b>2509-11</b> series devices <b>DO</b>
send BREAK when the power is <b>turned off</b>.</p>
      <p><b>2600</b> and <b>3600</b>
series devices (using the <b>NM-xxA</b> async modules)
work fine!</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2800</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">3800</span>
series devices (using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">HWIC-xxA</span>
async modules) work fine!</p>
      <p>The result of our testing is a very high confidence in
the Cisco 3600 series devices (3620, 3640, 3660 tested) and the Cisco
2600 series devices (2621 tested) with the NM-32A modules. They have
not sent a detectable BREAK signal under our test conditions.</p>
      <p>Cisco had an ECO (Engineering Change Order) for the <b>2511-RJ</b>
models only, which inhibited the BREAK when power was turned off. This
ECO was not
available for the non-RJ units. This was a change to the main board of
the units, and was in effect for hardware revisions <span style="font-weight: bold;">J and K</span>, 
but the ECO was
later revoked, deeming that the problem only affected a limited number
of sites.</p>
      <p>In one <span style="font-weight: bold;">2511</span>
that we tested, it appeared as though the DC
Ground was removed when the power was switched off, resulting in some
large potential voltages appearing on other signal lines, as the
reference ground between the terminal server and the host was lost. In
one test case, the target host was halted, and we actually lost data on
the drive, requiring four FSCK passes to get the system back on-line.
While I can't attribute this event to the terminal server sending
BREAK, I will note that this was the only time that we have seen any
data damaged on the target host during the testing.</p>
      <p>We have found one <span style="font-weight: bold;">2511</span>
which does not send BREAK! I
believe that this is attributable to the particular power supply in the
unit, but I wasn't able to open it up to get more information on
that particular unit. </p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.computone.com/Products/console_management.html">RAS-2000
units</a> <b>MAY</b> send BREAK (depending on which
which revision of the serial card hardware you have); they key is the
revision of the serial cards in the units, not the chassis! If BREAK is
a problem for you, get the <b>Rev. B</b> boards for your
chassis. With the older (Rev. A) boards, the ports will send BREAK when
power is <b>turned off</b> and <b>turned on</b>.
However, We tested a prototype of the Rev. B boards early in 2000, and
found that they solved the BREAK problem. We are hoping to get a
production Rev. B board once they get their backlog cleared. </p>
      <p>We also have a version of their <b>IntelliServer</b>
to test (good for use at a co-location site when you only need a small
number of ports). We are also negotiating to get an <b>RCM24</b>
or <b>RCM48</b> unit in for testing (one RU tall, and 24
or 48 ports).</p>
      <p>Note: (Summer of 2002) Computone was acquired by
Symbiat, and they no longer sell Console Server hardware. (I believe
they will still sell you a hardware support contract for currently
deployed Computone hardware...)</p>

      <p><b>NEWS: (March 2003) <a href="http://www.alturaxl.com/">Altura XL</a></b>
has bought the Computone IntelliServer&reg; RAS 2000 line from
Symbiat! I have received a production version of the REX-16RJ (rev B
card), and it has passed the BREAK tests. They say they are developing
24- and 48-port single rack-unit servers as well! I hope they will hire
the technical writer, as I believe the older Computone documentation
was probably the easiest to work with, regarding setting up console
services.</p>

      <p>The <b>AlterPath ACS 16</b>, <b>ACS-1</b>,
      <b>TS2000</b>, <b>TS800</b>, and the <b>PR3000</b>
models have passed our BREAK tests.</p>
      <p>The <b>PR-3000</b> device is actually a
combination, stackable unit. There is a Main Unit, and then you can
daisy-chain attach a number of multi-port Pods. During our early tests,
the PR-3000 was the first device that seemed to have a BREAK problem
due to software, versus hardware. We had found that if the main unit
*and* the pod lose power at the same time, a BREAK would be sent when
the main unit finished booting, and it then initialized the pod.
Cycling only one or the other did not send BREAK.</p>
      <p>We reported our test cases and results to Cyclades, and
they turned out a software revision within two weeks. We found that
this had solved the problem. They report that this fix will be rolled
into the standard code tree, so any newer revisions should include this
fix.</p>
      <p>We have returned our testing unit to Cyclades, at their
request. They are phasing this product out of the sales chain, though
they will be continuing to sell it in a few markets, and they say they
will be maintaining support for units already in the field.</p>
      <p>We received our <a href="http://www.cyclades.com/products/stdalone/ts1_2000.php">TS2000</a>
unit to test, and it has performed in the BEAK test very well. These
come in a variety of port densities, from 4 to 48, and they even sell a
1-port (<a href="http://www.cyclades.com/products/stdalone/ts100.php">TS100</a>
unit for applications where you really need an ethernet-based serial
port to talk to a console, etc.)</p>
You may have noticed the <i><b>Linux Inside</b></i>
icons on the Cyclades web site, and the stickers on their TS products.
We now have the Software Developers Kit for the TSnnn family, and we
will be trying to port Conserver to the unit directly. (If you are
interested in the outcome of this effort, please sign up for the
Conserver Announcements email list on the <a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver main page</a>.)
      <p>We received an <a href="http://www.cyclades.com/products/index.php?id=3">ACS 16</a>
in early December 2003 for testing. The unit has a dark blue paint
coating, darker than the TS2000 pebble-finish paint job. The other
difference that caught my eye on first look was that the status LEDs
for each port are now on the RJ-45 jack itself, which is good if you
want your LEDs and cables on the same side of the server. Finally,
there was an assortment of DB-25 and DB-9 pre-wired adapters in the
box, as well a male-RJ45-to-female-RJ45 adapter to connect a Cisco
console to the Cyclades AlterPath RJ45 wiring scheme. I'm glad to see
this type of hardware available from the vendors.</p>
      <p>As for the BREAK testing, the unit passed, but this was
something I expected. The hardware under the hood is largely an
expansion of the TS product line, as far as the serial path hardware is
concerned. There is more memory in the unit, and the two PCMCIA slots
on the opposite side from the serial and power connections.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2003, I also had the chance to test a
couple of Cyclades smaller units! The <b>TS800</b> (8-port
unit) is small, easily portable, and doesn't send BREAK. This is small
and light enough to carry in your laptop case, giving a field service
person the ability to quickly connect 8 serial devices to their laptop
for field work. It's also a good low-power device to use with your UPS,
to ensure that you can get console access to those few critical devices
you have at the core of your critical networks! The other unit was a
prototype <b>ACS-1</b>, which is a 1-port version of the
ACS (giving you the power of the ACS line, as well as the PCMCIA slots,
and the RS-232 port and RS-422/485 ports as well. This unit is a bit
larger than the TS-1 (the ACS-1 I have is 1.5" x 6.5" x 4"), and uses a
middle-of-the-cord single-voltage switch-mode power supply. This is a
beefy little computer, with a few interfaces, and a single serial port
to connect to an adjacent device, and will probably lend itself well to
Home Automation.</p>

      <p><b>NOTE:</b> Cyclades has produced a good
booklet, supporting remote console management, and comparing it to
other system management options. You can get a free copy from their

      <p>The PortServer TS line is small (front-to-back), and
lightweight, making it easy for one person to install it. Configuration
was also easy, out of the box. The one part I had trouble spotting was
that the ports needs to be configured as 'printers' to allow the
reverse-TCP connections from Conserver. Use the command;</p>
      <ul>
        <p><i>set port range-1-16 dev=prn</i></p>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a few LEDs on the front of these units, but
the functions are basic. If you like LEDs to see the status of your
serial lines, take a look at their <a href="http://www.digi.com/solutions/devtermsrv/cm/index.shtml">CM
series</a> before you by a TS unit.</p>
      <p>I tested a <b>CM 8</b>, and it performed
very well in the BREAK tests. But, I was also impressed with their
documentation. The steps in the manual follow the structure of their
Command Line menu tree (which is also reflected in their Web-based
config GUI), but they also have a great 'getting started' overview
poster, which will help get admins working quickly.</p>

      <p>The CM software also supports PCMCIA cards, and the
system is geared to easily configure various PC Card devices and
interfaces including memory drives, NICs, and wireless NICs. I found
this aspect of the configuration to be much simpler on the Digi CM,
because of the software and the manual combined. </p>

      <p>I also tried testing the integration with other power
controllers, but the firmware I was testing only recognized a
BayTech-DCD device. (I was surprised that the software didn't list a
selection for the <a href="http://www.digi.com/products/consolemanagement/digiremotepowermanager.jsp">Digi
RPM 8</a> power controller. Perhaps that is an OEM'd product, or
maybe I have old firmware? I will look into firmware upgrades this

      <p>The <a href="http://www.perle.com/products/prod_family/console_server/cs9000.html">Perle
CS9000</a> is designed to be a Console Server first, although it
also has plenty of dialup/terminal server features. One handy example
is that the CS9000 starts off with ports set for reverse-telnet
service, right out of the box. It will try to configure itself using
DHCP, but it also has a dedicated "admin" (RS-232) serial port for
configuring the unit manually. Another fine feature is the way the
hardware was designed to avoid the BREAK problem. (The unit I tested
was probably the cleanest power cycle I observed at the serial port.)
And the units boot quickly in stand-alone mode.</p>

      <p>One feature that I really like is that the console
server ports use an ethernet NIC-style RJ-45 jack, with an LED on
either side of the locking tab of the jack...one LED indicates input
traffic on that port, while the other LED indicates outbound traffic.
Having these LEDs on the same side of the units as the cables is a good
thing, in my opinion. Using these illuminated jacks is a great idea, as
the LEDs are literally part of the jack, so you don't have to think
hard to compare a bank of LEDs to a bank of cables.</p>

you'll never need more than 4 ports, and you definitely need something
