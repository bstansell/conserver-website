version 1.1 (updated: 
Jul 26, 2008, 12:37 am)</h4>

<P>The main purpose of this FAQ is to answer questions about how we acquire the 
equipment for testing, why we do it, and how it happens. This page is meant
mainly for Console Server hardware vendors who want to know how to get their
equipment to be evaluated.</p>

<a name="who"></a><p><b>Who is doing the testing? (Who is 'we'?)</b></p>

<p>Mainly, the answer is 'me' (David K. Z. Harris), but during the lifetime of
this project, the testing has also relied on the efforts of many folks involved 
with the development of the open source <a href="http://www.conserver.com/">Conserver</a> 
application.</p>

<p>While the testing has been supported, in part, by my employers, this was 
largely because they also benefited from the information being generated by
this project, and the support mainly consisted of allowing me to carry on the
work in addition to my normal work efforts. However, while I was employed by 
<a href="http://www.gnac.com/">Global Networking and Computing</a> and 
<a href="http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty Solutions</a>, I was
allowed to use space in the data centers, as well as use of the network 
facilities to maintain an active testbed, which greatly helped my testing.
My recent work in many data centers has afforded me with working access to
a variety of older terminal servers, and my testing provides me with access 
to newer console servers.</p>

<a name="why"></a><p><b>Why are we performing the testing?</b></p>

<p>While this is covered in greater detail on the <a href="breakoff.html">main 
test page</a> and the <a href="breaktest.html">test results page</a>, here is 
a brief summary;</p>

<p><ul>
   <li>I've worked in large enterprise, engineering, and production networks, 
       and in contracting realms
   <li>I plan to need the information myself in the future
   <li>Because I expect serial consoles to be around for any years to come
   <li>As a member of <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> and 
       <a href="http://www.sage.org/">SAGE</a>. I plan to teach more tutorials.
   <li>I've received great feedback from the Sysadmin community, worldwide, 
       for posting the information thus far...
</ul></p>

<p>As the technical arena surrounding &quot;<i>Lights-Out Management</i>&quot;
continues to grow and evolve, I plan to stay in the forefront of the 
developments.  For me, that means to continue to test new products, and 
evaluate their capabilities, including integration with remote-controlled
Power Distribution Units (PDUs), KVM, Service Processors, and UPS gear.</p>

<a name="cost"></a><p><b>What does the testing cost?</b></p>

<p>There is no charge, or fee, for the testing. However, there may be a 
material cost to the vendor for loaning the equipment out for testing. 
(They may not be able to sell the equipment as &quot;new&quot; after I 
have had it for testing, but they can often use it as an RMA or 'spare' 
part). There are also, normally, some shipping costs involved.</p>

<p>There are no costs connected to the testing, nor to the posting of 
results on these web pages. (Any donation of equipment to the testing 
will not influence the testing results, nor the posted comments. If a 
donation is made, it may be noted on the 
<a href="breakacks.html">BREAK Test acknowledgments</a> page, at the 
discretion of the manufacturer.)</p>

<a name="how"></a><p><b>How does the testing occur?</b> 

<p>The process begins when I contact a manufacturer, or when a manufacturer 
contacts me, and expresses an interest in testing a particular model of 
hardware. I establish a point of contact for the duration of the testing 
(often a product manager, or an executive). I do not want to have a 
support contract, or special access to support technical staff. (If I 
cannot find the answers in the documentation, or on the manufacturer's 
website, I will then work with my contact to find an answer.) Part
of my testing includes looking at the user interface, in-box instructions, 
and working with the vendors freely available documentation, the way most 
new customers would receive their first unit from the manufacturer. To 
that end, I prefer a new unit, but I will accept RMA/refurbished hardware, 
in 'as-new' packaging (so that I receive the same cables, adapters, 
software and manuals that come with a new unit).</p>

<p>I may need to sign a non-disclosure agreement, if I'm testing 
unreleased hardware, or evaluating new designs. I'm aware of two product
designs where my work with the vendor influenced a change before full
production was started. I don't share NDA information. However, I 
reserve the right to post findings on my website about testing results 
for released hardware.</p>

<p>I don't buy the equipment, as I have no equipment budget for that. 
Fortunately, I now have enough of a track record that this is usually 
not a problem.</p>

</p>A test schedule will be developed, outlining what features will 
be tested (normally the BREAK testing, but sometimes may include SSH 
or other tests), and a schedule is developed. Testing typically takes 
between 2-4 weeks. The manufacturer will normally pay the cost of the 
first shipment (from them, to me).</p>

<p>At the end of the test period, I prepare the equipment for return 
to the manufacturer, in the original packaging. I typically pay the 
return (ground) shipping.</p>

<a name="carrot"></a><p><b>What's in it for the manufacturer?</b></p>

<p>During the testing, I will follow up with my contact in email, including;

<ul>
   <li>Pointing out typographic errors in the documentation
   <li>Pointing out areas where I was confused, and offering suggestions for
       how the confusion could be avoided (user interface changes, 
       documentation updates, adding/changing an illustration, etc.)
   <li>Test results
   <li>Answering any questions I can (without violating any other NDAs) about
       Console Server hardware, Conserver, and Lights-Out Management issues.
</ul>

<p>While <b><i>I</i></b> also benefit from the testing (by becoming more 
familiar with another family of equipment, seeing a new GUI, trying new 
features), there is also some benefit to the manufacturer, because it 
means that I may also be able to answer questions, and offer opinions, 
about their hardware. The longer I have to work with it, the more 
familiar I can become with it. I also have the ability to loan the 
hardware to other technical folks, so that they can also get some
(more) experience with the hardware.</p>

<a name="canI"></a><p><b>Who decides what ends up on the review?</b></p>

<p>Again, that would be 'me'. If the manufacturer has concerns about 
how the results of the testing and review of the effort may turn out, 
those would be brought up before the testing commitment is made. I 
will air the good, and the bad, based on my opinions and my experience. 
In this regard, I wear my 'Customer Advocate' hat.  I reserve all 
rights to control the information pasted to these web pages.</p>

<p>That said, I <b>DO</b> give advanced information to my contact 
person before the pages are posted. They often get 1-2 weeks of lead 
time, during the testing, where they are receiving questions and 
feedback, and I will often send a copy of the review that I plan to 
put on the web.</p>

<p>I do ask contact what the manufacturer would prefer regarding;

<ul>
   <li>Using 'Deep Links' to their product pages, or not.
   <li>Whether I should list a specific contact for 'more info'...
   <ul>
      <li>whether to use a person, or a 'role' contact
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>If there is an equipment donation, I also ask if/how the donation 
should be listed on the <a href="breakacks.html">acknowledgments page</a>.</p>
